We're going to build a command line text editor from scratch in Python. If you'd like to learn the most out of this, I'd recommend to code along. When we encounter problems, I'll try to state them first before suggesting a solution. I encourage you to pause and give yourself about fifteen minutes to try to solve it first. If you're still stuck, move along and compare the solution with your own approach. It's also totally fine if you simply read through at your leisure.

If you prefer to play around with the final end-to-end solution, check out the [accompanying repo](https://github.com/seem/editor).

One more thing, if you struggle to even get started, reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/wasimlorgat) or via [email](mailto:mwlorgat@gmail.com) and I'll try my best to help.

Let's dive right in!

## Create a curses application

We'll use the [`curses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html) library to avoid having to deal with low level issues like efficiently painting to the terminal screen and receiving user input. I'm going to skim over specifics about `curses` so we can focus on the editor itself. Please refer to [the docs](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html) if you'd like to dig a little deeper.

Start with a barebones `curses` application. Create a file, `editor.py`, and begin with the following:

``` python
import curses


def main(stdscr):
    while True:
        k = stdscr.getkey()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    curses.wrapper(main)
```

`curses.wrapper` prepares your terminal and later restores its original state. It then passes an object that represents the terminal screen, called `stdscr` (short for *standard screen* like standard in, out, and error).

## A way out

*Problem 1.* If you run this, the only way out will be a keyboard interrupt with `Ctrl-c`. That's not great, add a cleaner way out.

*Solution.* `stdscr.getkey` blocks until a key is pressed, then stores it into the `k` variable, which is mapped to a `sys.exit` call to cleanly exit the application.

*(Comments like `# ...` signal that lines from the previous snippet are unchanged. In this case, `import curses` remains the first line of `editor.py`, and the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block remains at the end of the file.)*

``` python
# ...
import sys


def main(stdscr):
    while True:
        k = stdscr.getkey()
        if k == "q":
            sys.exit(0)

# ...
```

Running the script should land you in a blank page. Then pressing `q` should get you back out.

``` bash
$ python editor.py
```

## Load and view a file

*Problem 2.* Before we can edit text, we'll need to be able to display it. Add a way for a user to specify a file. Load that file into memory and display it in the curses window.

*Solution.* Add an `ArgumentParser` that expects a single `filename`, reads the file's contents to a variable. In the main loop, display each row of the file with `stdscr.addstr`.

``` python
import argparse

# ...

def main(stdscr):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("filename")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    with open(args.filename) as f:
        buffer = f.readlines()

    while True:
        stdscr.erase()
        for row, line in enumerate(buffer):
            stdscr.addstr(row, 0, line)

        k = stdscr.getkey()
        if k == "q":
            sys.exit(0)

# ...
```

The contents of the file are stored in-memory until they're ready to be rewritten into a file, hence the name *buffer*. Text editor buffers have some [interesting implementations](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~crowley/papers/sds.pdf), but we won't get into that just yet.

Rerun the application, this time pointing it to a file:

``` bash
$ python editor.py editor.py
```

The double `editor.py` isn't a typo. We're editing the source of the editor! Which you should now be able to view in your terminal.

## View the buffer through a window

*Problem 3.* Depending on the size of your screen, you may have seen the following error:

``` pytb
_curses.error: addwstr() returned ERR
```

The application is trying to draw the buffer beyond the length of the screen! In order to fix that, introduce a *window* with some *width* and *height*, and trim the rendered buffer to the width and height of the window.

*Solution.* Add a `Window` class with `n_rows` and `n_cols` attributes. In the main function, instantiate a `Window` with size `(curses.LINES - 1, curses.COLS - 1)`; these are constants that hold the number of lines and columns in the current curses window. Then trim the buffer before rendering it in the main loop.

*(The comment `# ... def main(stdscr):` hints that the text immediately following it belongs to the `main` function.)*

``` python
# ...

class Window:
    def __init__(self, n_rows, n_cols):
        self.n_rows = n_rows
        self.n_cols = n_cols

# ... def main(stdscr):

    window = Window(curses.LINES - 1, curses.COLS - 1)

    while True:
        stdscr.erase()
        for row, line in enumerate(buffer[:window.n_rows]):
            stdscr.addstr(row, 0, line[:window.n_cols])

# ...
```

## Move the cursor through the buffer

*Problem 4.* The next step towards editing is cursor movement. Introduce a *cursor*, positioned at a given *row* and *column*. For now, initiate the cursor at `(0, 0)`, then render the `stdscr` cursor at the current position. Don't add any movement functionality just yet.

*Solution.* Create a `Cursor` class with attributes `row` and `col`, both default to 0. Instantiate a `Cursor` in `main`, and call `stdscr.move` to the current cursor position in the main loop:

``` python
# ...

class Cursor:
    def __init__(self, row=0, col=0):
        self.row = row
        self.col = col

# ... def main(stdscr):

    window = Window(curses.LINES - 1, curses.COLS - 1)
    cursor = Cursor()

    while True:
        stdscr.erase()
        for row, line in enumerate(buffer[:window.n_rows]):
            stdscr.addstr(row, 0, line[:window.n_cols])
        stdscr.move(cursor.row, cursor.col)

# ...
```

The cursor should now be displayed at `(0, 0)`.

*Problem 5.* Next, add cursor movement. Define a method for each direction: `up`, `down`, `left`, and `right`, each of which update the `row` or `col` as required. Then map the arrow keys to these cursor movement methods in the main loop.

*Solution.*

``` python
# ... class Cursor:

    def up(self):
        self.row -= 1

    def down(self):
        self.row += 1

    def left(self):
        self.col -= 1

    def right(self):
        self.col += 1

# ... def main(stdscr):

        k = stdscr.getkey()
        if k == "q":
            sys.exit(0)
        elif k == "KEY_UP":
            cursor.up()
        elif k == "KEY_DOWN":
            cursor.down()
        elif k == "KEY_LEFT":
            cursor.left()
        elif k == "KEY_RIGHT":
            cursor.right()

# ...
```

Rerun the application and give it a spin. It works great! Until...

*Problem 6.* It crashes when you try to move outside of the screen. We should probably restrict the cursor within the buffer.

*(You may have already solved this in your solution to Problem 5. If so, well done, and feel free to skip ahead!)*

*Solution.* Update the movement methods to only move if they'll remain within the buffer. Since cursor movement now depends on buffer properties, we also need to pass the `buffer` through as an argument:

``` python
# ... class Cursor:

    def up(self):
        if self.row > 0:
            self.row -= 1

    def down(self, buffer):
        if self.row < len(buffer) - 1:
            self.row += 1

    def left(self):
        if self.col > 0:
            self.col -= 1

    def right(self, buffer):
        if self.col < len(buffer[self.row]):
            self.col += 1

# ... def main(stdscr):

        k = stdscr.getkey()
        if k == "q":
            sys.exit(0)
        elif k == "KEY_UP":
            cursor.up()
        elif k == "KEY_DOWN":
            cursor.down(buffer)
        elif k == "KEY_LEFT":
            cursor.left()
        elif k == "KEY_RIGHT":
            cursor.right(buffer)

# ...
```

*Problem 7.* Almost there. Cursor movement should now mostly work, except that when moving to a shorter line the cursor will float outside the buffer. Fix that.

*Solution.* Restrict the cursor's `col` to be within the line we move to:

``` python
# ... class Cursor:

    def up(self, buffer):
        if self.row > 0:
            self.row -= 1
            self._clamp_col(buffer)

    def down(self, buffer):
        if self.row < len(buffer) - 1:
            self.row += 1
            self._clamp_col(buffer)

    def _clamp_col(self, buffer):
        self.col = min(self.col, len(buffer[self.row]))

# ... def main(stdscr):

        k = stdscr.getkey()
        if k == "q":
            sys.exit(0)
        elif k == "KEY_UP":
            cursor.up(buffer)
        # ...

# ...
```

*Problem 8.* This works alright, but it's not the most convenient. Often when you move to a shorter line and back to the original line, you mean for the cursor to be as it was before you moved at all. Implement this functionality.

*Solution.* We can achieve this by introducing a new variable, `_col_hint`, that keeps track of the last `col` explicitly moved to, and instead use that to reset the column after line movements.

Whenever `col` is set by a horizontal movement, it should also update `_col_hint` to the same value. That value should be used when clamping. We can use a property and property setter to implement that.

``` python
# ...

class Cursor:
    def __init__(self, row=0, col=0, col_hint=None):
        self.row = row
        self._col = col
        self._col_hint = col if col_hint is None else col_hint

    @property
    def col(self):
        return self._col

    @col.setter
    def col(self, col):
        self._col = col
        self._col_hint = col

    # ...

    def _clamp_col(self, buffer):
        self._col = min(self._col_hint, len(buffer[self.row]))

# ...
```

Note that `_clamp_col` sets the internal variable `_col` directly, avoiding the setter thus not resetting `_col_hint`.

*Problem 9.* There's one final addition that should also improve the user experience. If the cursor is moved horizontally outside the buffer, wrap to the start (or end) of the next (or previous) line.

*Solution.*

``` python
# ... class Cursor:

    def left(self, buffer):
        if self.col > 0:
            self.col -= 1
        elif self.row > 0:
            self.row -= 1
            self.col = len(buffer[self.row])

    def right(self, buffer):
        if self.col < len(buffer[self.row]):
            self.col += 1
        elif self.row < len(buffer) - 1:
            self.row += 1
            self.col = 0

# ... def main(stdscr):

        elif k == "KEY_LEFT":
            cursor.left(buffer)

# ...
```

Give it a spin. All should work well except when the cursor moves outside of the window.

## Scroll the window to the cursor

*Problem 10.* We currently have no way of seeing any part of the buffer that's outside the window. Worse still, we can also move the cursor outside of the window! Scroll the window vertically as the cursor moves. Don't worry about horizontal scrolling for now.

*Solution.* Add `row` and `col` attributes to the `Window` that track the current position of the window as it scrolls through the buffer (specifically, the position of the top-left of the window). Then add methods to scroll the window vertically.

Having learned from cursor movement, we'll be sure to do the necessary checks the first time round: only scroll up if we're not already at the top of the buffer and if the cursor exceeds the top of the window, and similarly for downward scrolling. In the main loop, scroll the window after moving the cursor. And finally, update where we start slicing the buffer when rendering.

``` python
# ...

class Window:

    def __init__(self, n_rows, n_cols, row=0, col=0):
        self.n_rows = n_rows
        self.n_cols = n_cols
        self.row = row
        self.col = col

    @property
    def bottom(self):
        return self.row + self.n_rows - 1

    def up(self, cursor):
        if cursor.row == self.row - 1 and self.row > 0:
            self.row -= 1

    def down(self, buffer, cursor):
        if cursor.row == self.bottom + 1 and self.bottom < len(buffer) - 1:
            self.row += 1

# ... def main(stdscr):

    while True:
        stdscr.erase()
        for row, line in enumerate(buffer[window.row:window.row + window.n_rows]):
            stdscr.addstr(row, 0, line)
        stdscr.move(cursor.row, cursor.col)

# ...
        elif k == "KEY_UP":
            cursor.up()
            window.up(cursor)
        elif k == "KEY_DOWN":
            cursor.down(buffer)
            window.down(buffer, cursor)
        elif k == "KEY_LEFT":
            cursor.left()
            window.up(cursor)
        elif k == "KEY_RIGHT":
            cursor.right(buffer)
            window.down(buffer, cursor)
# ...
```

Note that left and right movement may require vertical scrolling since the cursor may be wrapped to the previous or next line.

The last crucial piece is to translate the cursor's actual position, which is in terms of the buffer, to be in terms of what's displayed: the window. Add a `translate` method to the window, and use it to render the cursor:

``` python
# ... class Window:

    def translate(self, cursor):
        return cursor.row - self.row, cursor.col - self.col

# ... def main(stdscr):

    while True:
        stdscr.erase()
        for row, line in enumerate(buffer[window.row:window.row + window.n_rows]):
            stdscr.addstr(row, 0, line)
        stdscr.move(*window.translate(cursor))

# ...
```

*Problem 11.* We've addressed vertical scrolling, but long lines still present an issue. There are two ways we might address long lines. We could either scroll the entire window with the cursor, as we did for vertical scrolling. This is how most editors work. Or we could scroll only the selected line to follow the cursor, which as far as I know is only implemented by [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/). Let's implement the second approach.

The desired behaviour is that when the cursor exceeds some margin away from the right edge of the window, the window should be moved one page to the right, and similarly for the left side.

*Solution.* Add a `horizontal_scroll` method to `Window` that implements this, and call it after any cursor movements in the main loop.

``` python
# ... class Window:

    def horizontal_scroll(self, cursor, left_margin=5, right_margin=2):
        n_pages = cursor.col // (self.n_cols - right_margin)
        self.col = max(n_pages * self.n_cols - right_margin - left_margin, 0)

# ... def main(stdscr):

        elif k == "KEY_UP":
            cursor.up()
            window.up(cursor)
            window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)
        elif k == "KEY_DOWN":
            cursor.down(buffer)
            window.down(buffer, cursor)
            window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)
        elif k == "KEY_LEFT":
            cursor.left()
            window.up(cursor)
            window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)
        elif k == "KEY_RIGHT":
            cursor.right(buffer)
            window.down(buffer, cursor)
            window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)

# ...
```

Next, update how the buffer renders long lines by including characters that indicate that a given line has more content on the left (`«`) or right (`»`).

``` python
# ... def main(stdscr):

    while True:
        stdscr.erase()
        for row, line in enumerate(buffer[window.row:window.row + window.n_rows]):
            if row == cursor.row - window.row and window.col > 0:
                line = "«" + line[window.col + 1:]
            if len(line) > window.n_cols:
                line = line[:window.n_cols - 1] + "»"
            stdscr.addstr(row, 0, line)
        stdscr.move(*window.translate(cursor))

    # ...
```

## Edit the buffer

And now to the key ingredient, actually editing text!

Start by adding a `Buffer` class that wraps the list of lines. Implement `__len__` and `__getitem__` so that any dependents of `buffer` needn't change. Set `buffer` to a `Buffer` instance instead of the current list of lines.

``` python
# ...

class Buffer:
    def __init__(self, lines):
        self.lines = lines

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.lines)

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.lines[index]

# ... def main(stdscr):

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("filename")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    with open(args.filename) as f:
        buffer = Buffer(f.read().splitlines())

# ...
```

Now's a good time for a tiny refactor: extract `len(buffer) - 1` to the `Buffer.bottom` property. You might argue that this isn't worth being extracted. My reasoning is that the last column in a line is `len(buffer[row])` whereas the last row in a buffer is `len(buffer) - 1`, and I can never get it right the first time!

I think it's good to be aware of the kinds of bugs you tend to introduce, rather than to always follow a dogmatic approach. It also has a nice symmetry with `Window.bottom`, though that's less important. It might be worth considering doing similar for `len(buffer[row])`, but I find that easy to remember and already concise.

``` python
# ... class Buffer:

    @property
    def bottom(self):
        return len(self) - 1

# ... class Cursor:

    def down(self, buffer):
        if self.row < buffer.bottom:
            self.row += 1
            self._clamp_col(buffer)

    # ...

    def right(self, buffer):
        if self.col < len(buffer[self.row]):
            self.col += 1
        elif self.row < buffer.bottom:
            self.row += 1
            self.col = 0

# ... class Window:

    def down(self, buffer, cursor):
        if cursor.row == self.bottom + 1 and self.bottom < buffer.bottom:
            self.row += 1

# ...
```

We'll be adding three methods to the buffer: `insert`, `split`, and `delete`.

### Insert a string into the buffer

*Problem 12.* If an unmapped key is pressed, insert it into the buffer at the current cursor position.

*Solution.*

Since the buffer stores text as a list of lines, and the cursor moves through a two-dimensional space, there's a tiny bit of work we need to do to insert text at a given cursor.

Pop the line under the cursor, split it at the cursor, and concatenate the before part, the string to be inserted, and the after part. Insert the concatenated string into the buffer at the cursor. And as usual, call the method in the main loop. This case differs slightly from previous, in that we'll map all unmapped keys to `Buffer.insert`. That's probably not ideal, for example, a user might enter `Ctrl-i` which will write `^I` to the buffer, but it'll do for now.

``` python
# ... class Buffer:

    def insert(self, cursor, string):
        row, col = cursor.row, cursor.col
        current = self.lines.pop(row)
        new = current[:col] + string + current[col:]
        self.lines.insert(row, new)

# ... def main(stdscr):

    if k == "q":
        sys.exit(0)
    # ...
    else:
        buffer.insert(cursor, k)

# ...
```

Test it out. It'll insert text, but won't move the cursor after the inserted text. All we need to do is move right for each inserted character. Since we already have a command to move the cursor right (and scroll the window as needed), now's the time to extract a `right` function and re-use it:

``` python
# ...

def right(window, buffer, cursor):
    cursor.right(buffer)
    window.down(buffer, cursor)
    window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)

# ... def main(stdscr):

    elif k == "KEY_RIGHT":
        right(window, buffer, cursor)
    # ...
    else:
        buffer.insert(cursor, k)
        for _ in k:
            right(window, buffer, cursor)

# ...
```

### Split a line in the buffer

*Probem 12.* If you hit enter, you won't get the expected result, which is to split the line at the cursor.

*Solution.* Implement `split` as below, similar to `insert`.

``` python
# ... class Buffer:

    def split(self, cursor):
        row, col = cursor.row, cursor.col
        current = self.lines.pop(row)
        self.lines.insert(row, current[:col])
        self.lines.insert(row + 1, current[col:])

# ... def main(stdscr):

    elif k == "\n":
        buffer.split(cursor)
        right(window, buffer, cursor)

# ...
```

### Delete a character from the buffer

*Problem 13.* As in the previous section, hitting delete or backspace won't give the expected result. Start by implementing a delete command, bound to the delete key, that deletes the character under the cursor.

*Solution.* Add a `delete` method. If the cursor is at the last position in the buffer, don't do anything. Otherwise, there are two options. Either the cursor is inside a line, then follow similar logic to `insert` but instead of adding a string remove a character. Or the cursor is at the end of the line, then join the current line to the next.

``` python
# ... class Buffer:

    def delete(self, cursor):
        row, col = cursor.row, cursor.col
        if (row, col) < (self.bottom, len(self[row])):
            current = self.lines.pop(row)
            if col < len(self[row]):
                new = current[:col] + current[col + 1:]
                self.lines.insert(row, new)
            else:
                next = self.lines.pop(row)
                new = current + next
                self.lines.insert(row, new)

# ... def main(stdscr):

    elif k in ("KEY_DELETE", "\x04"):
        buffer.delete(cursor)

# ...
```

On MacOS, curses doesn't correctly decode the backspace and delete keys, they're instead returned as `\x7f` and `\x04` respectively. I haven't found a satisfactory answer for why this is the case. If you know, I'd love to hear!

*Problem 14.* Implement backspace.

*Solution.* Backspace can be implemented by moving left and then deleting. Just as we extracted a `right` function for insertion, we'll extract a `left` function here:

``` python
# ...

def left(window, buffer, cursor):
    cursor.left(buffer)
    window.up(cursor)
    window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)

# ... def main(stdscr):

    elif k in ("KEY_BACKSPACE", "\x7f"):
        if (cursor.row, cursor.col) > (0, 0):
            left(window, buffer, cursor)
            buffer.delete(cursor)

# ...
```

And look at that! You've built a minimal yet functional text editor.

*Problem 15.* There's one key piece of functionality still missing: saving the edited file. I'll leave that as the final unsolved problem.

## What next?

I hope you enjoyed working through this, and that you learned something new. If you did or if you have any other questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/wasimlorgat) or via [email](mailto:mwlorgat@gmail.com).

If this whet your appetite and you're looking for more, here are some exercises you might find interesting, in roughly increasing difficulty:

1.  Remap cursor movement to `Ctrl-p` (up), `Ctrl-n` (down), `Ctrl-b` (left), and `Ctrl-f` (right).
2.  Add page up and page down commands.
3.  Add a command to save the buffer to a file.
4.  Rewrite horizontal scrolling to move the entire window rather than only the current line.
5.  Add a status line to the bottom of the window that displays the name of the file being edited and the current cursor position.
6.  Add commands to move one word left or right.
7.  If the buffer is modified and not yet saved, print a message in the status line and don't let the user exit. Add a force exit command as well.
8.  Rewrite the application so that there's no mutable state. I've found [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) with the `dataclass.replace` function a convenient way to write applications around immutable objects.

Most data problems [don't need the horsepower of Spark or Hadoop](https://vickiboykis.com/2017/03/20/should-you-replace-hadoop-with-your-laptop/).
If all of your data fits comfortably in memory, pandas may be a great fit.
pandas is my goto for quickly building out production pipelines that are both efficient and easy to maintain.

One issue I've run into is that pandas doesn't natively log. Fortunately, it allows extending the dataframe API with [accessors](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/development/extending.html#registering-custom-accessors).
We have since implemented an accessor for logging in the publicly avilable [`pdlog`](https://github.com/dataprophet/pdlog) package.

To get started:

1. Install `pdlog`:

    ```sh
    pip install pdlog
    ```
2. Import `pdlog` in your application:

    ```python
    import pdlog
    ```
3. Add `.log` before your method calls:

    ```python
    df = df.log.dropna()
    ```

    They'll now log useful information about the operation, for example:

    ```output
    2020-05-26 20:55:30,049 INFO <pdlog> dropna: dropped 1 row (17%), 5 rows remaining
    ```

It works by registering a custom `LogAccessor` under the `.log` namespace on import.
The accessor containes a collection of wrapper methods that log what they're doing.

    "text": "import ipywidgets\nimport time\nfrom threading import Thread\n\nLet’s start with a very simple interface. An input text, a submit button, and an output text (disabled=True so that it’s not editable):\n\ninput_ = ipywidgets.Text(\"Hey ChatGPT, please summarise this text.\")\nbutton = ipywidgets.Button(description=\"Submit\")\noutput = ipywidgets.Text(disabled=True)\ndisplay(input_, button, output)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis won’t do anything yet. We need to setup an on_click callback first. We’ll fake a request to OpenAI that simply sleeps for half a second then returns a fixed string. Then we’ll update the output text’s value with the result:\n\ndef request_open_ai(prompt):\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    return \"Here's a summary of your text.\"\n\n\ndef update_output(text):\n    output.value = text\n\n\ndef on_click(button):\n    text = request_open_ai(input_.value)\n    update_output(text)\n\n\nbutton.on_click(on_click)\n\nIf you click “Submit” now, it should populate the output after half a second.\nIf we do this synchronously and in the main thread, the entire UI will hang during the requestOpenAi call. So instead, we can separate that call into another thread. I think ipywidgets already does a version of this for us. But if it didn’t, here’s a very rough version of how we’d do it:\n\nThread(target=request_open_ai, args=(input,)).run()\n\nBut then how do we get the result and update the output with it? It’s often trickier to pass data across threads. Instead, we define our request function so that it accepts a callback that gets called with the result:\n\ndef request_open_ai(prompt, on_completion):\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    on_completion(\"Here's a summary of your text.\")\n\n\ndef on_click(button):\n    Thread(target=request_open_ai, args=(input, update_output)).run()\n\n\ninput_ = ipywidgets.Text(\"Hey ChatGPT, please summarise this text.\")\nbutton = ipywidgets.Button(description=\"Submit\")\noutput = ipywidgets.Text(disabled=True)\nbutton.on_click(on_click)\ndisplay(input_, button, output)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis works okay, but starts to get very confusing as you add more and more nested callbacks. In fact, it can get so bad that it’s been nicknamed callback hell. Someone was so frustrated with it that they even created a website! This is where async/await becomes useful, since it looks a lot more like ordinary programming:\n\nimport asyncio\n\n\nasync def request_open_ai(prompt):\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    return \"Here's a summary of your text.\"\n\n\nasync def on_click(button):\n    text = await request_open_ai(input_.value)\n    update_output(text)\n\nNote how these functions look a lot similar to the original synchronous ones instead of having the weird callbacks.\nIn most UI frameworks, we’d be able to pass in an async function like the new on_click. I’m not sure how to do that with ipywidgets, so we need to define a little wrapper that synchronously calls the async function, so we can set it as the button’s on_click handler (confusing, I know):\n\ndef on_click_sync(button):\n    coroutine = on_click(button)\n    asyncio.ensure_future(coroutine)\n\n\ninput_ = ipywidgets.Text(\"Hey ChatGPT, please summarise this text.\")\nbutton = ipywidgets.Button(description=\"Submit\")\noutput = ipywidgets.Text(disabled=True)\nbutton.on_click(on_click_sync)\ndisplay(input_, button, output)"

This gets the relevant jinja Template from the Environment, renders it with the provided context, and writes the result to the final output directory.\n\n\nAs you can see, Generators are responsible for glueing together the lower-level components: Reader, jinja Template, and Writer. In order to understand each of these components, we’ll reimplement the core logic of a Generator from scratch!"

I’m chuffed with how easy this was. I typed this out exactly as I used it, and everything worked first time with zero errors. I think it would’ve been neat if I could use --width and --height to crop the image after a --selector is applied, but in the end I could get what I wanted using a single line of --javascript."

For those less familiar, this form of testing is common in projects that use nbdev.\nHere’s what actually happens:\n\nThe nbprocess_test command creates a ProcessPoolExecutor with some number of workers and tasks (each notebook being a separate task).\nWorker 1 processes one task, say task 1, which creates an IPython InteractiveShell, then runs import fastai.callbacks.progress which adds ProgressCallback to the the variable fastcore.basics.defaults.\nWorker 1 processes another task, say task 3, which creates a fresh InteractiveShell, calls learner.fit, and tests stdout. Since ProgressCallback has been registered in this process by task 1, a progress bar is also printed to stdout, breaking the test.\n\nLet’s break down the underlying mechanics. There are three behaviours that come together to cause this sequence of events:\n\nProcessPoolExecutors reuse processes. It seems obvious in hindsight since that’s how pools usually work, but I had never realised it until now. In the example above, worker 1 executes task 1 and task 3 in the same process.\nfastai callbacks register themselves on import. In this case, fastai.callbacks.progress adds ProgressCallback to defaults.callbacks.\nChanges to imported modules persist across IPython InteractiveShells. nbprocess_test runs each test in parallel using execnb, which implements a sub-class of InteractiveShell.\n\nNext, we’ll verify these behaviours with tiny experiments. I highly recommend using tiny experiments to understand complex systems."

Start by creating a pool with 2 max_workers:\n\nfrom concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor\n\npool = ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=2)\n\nThere aren’t any processes in the pool yet:\n\npool._processes\n\n{}\n\n\nSubmit a task: the function os.getpid, which will return the process ID of the worker that runs it. Since there are no processes in the pool, submit will start a new worker process, and have it execute the task. ProcessPoolExecutor.submit returns a Future object, and Future.result returns the task’s return value:\n\nimport os\n\nfuture = pool.submit(os.getpid)\nfuture.result()\n\n45907\n\n\nNo matter how many times you manually rerun the above cell, it will aways be executed on the same process. Notice that the process is now also available in the pool:\n\npool._processes\n\n{45907: &lt;SpawnProcess name='SpawnProcess-1' pid=45907 parent=45899 started&gt;}\n\n\nIf we submit another task:\n\nfuture = pool.submit(os.getpid)\nfuture.result()\n\n45907\n\n\n…it’s still executed on the same process.\nLet’s try executing two processes at the same time:\n\nfutures = [pool.submit(os.getpid) for _ in range(2)]\n[o.result() for o in futures]\n\n[45907, 45907]\n\n\nWeird.

I haven’t confirmed this, but I suspect that when we submitted two futures, the pool determined that it needed more workers, so it started another. However, the first worker’s task ended before the second worker started up, so the first worker processed both.\nSince we instantiated the pool with 2 max_workers, these two processes will execute all tasks, no matter how many we submit:\n\nfutures = [pool.submit(os.getpid) for _ in range(10)]\n[o.result() for o in futures]\n\n[45907, 45907, 45907, 45907, 45907, 45907, 45907, 45907, 45907, 45907]\n\n\nShutdown the pool to free up any resources:\n\npool.shutdown()"

Yes it does, but it turns out that changes to imported modules persist across shells.\n\nfrom execnb.shell import CaptureShell\n\nFirst make sure that CaptureShell doesn’t have a foo attribute - this will make sense in a second:\n\nassert not hasattr(CaptureShell, 'foo')\n\nNow add the foo attribute:\n\nCaptureShell.foo = 'bar'\n\nWe can see foo inside a CaptureShell:\n\nshell = CaptureShell()\nshell.run('from execnb.shell import CaptureShell; CaptureShell.foo')\nshell.result\n\n'bar'\n\n\nThis happens because when we first imported from the execnb.shell module it was cached in sys.modules:\n\nimport sys\n\nsys.modules['execnb.shell']\n\n&lt;module 'execnb.shell' from '/Users/seem/code/execnb/execnb/shell.py'&gt;\n\n\nIn fact, sys.modules['execnb.shell'].CaptureShell is another name for CaptureShell:\n\nsys.modules['execnb.shell'].CaptureShell is CaptureShell\n\nTrue\n\n\nPython caches imports to speed up consecutive imports from the same modules. InteractiveShell (and its sub-classes) have the same sys.modules which causes this behaviour:\n\nshell = CaptureShell()\nshell.run(\"import sys; sys.modules['execnb.shell'].CaptureShell.foo\")\nshell.result\n\n'bar'\n\n\nexec with empty globals and locals uses the same sys.modules too so it doesn’t avoid the issue:\n\nexec(\"import sys; print('execnb.shell' in sys.modules)\", {}, {})\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nexec(\"from execnb.shell import CaptureShell; print(CaptureShell.foo)\", {}, {})\n\nbar\n\n\n\nIn the end, we agreed that the test itself was broken, because it made assumptions about its environment without ensuring that they were true. Tests like this may fail - regardless of the above behaviour - if we import any module that registers a callback. For example, this fails too:\nfrom fastai.callback.progress import *\nfrom nbprocess.test import test_nb\n\ntest_nb('nbs/nb_with_failing_test.ipynb')\nThe fix is to explicitly run learner.fit with the precise list of callbacks required."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I recently started learning macOS development using SwiftUI as part of my latest project: building a macOS Jupyter frontend. While I’m loving Swift (the language) and SwiftUI (the UI framework), it’s sometimes extremely difficult to find out information that feels like it should be readily available.\nThe latest such case is how to use an NSTableView in SwiftUI. SwiftUI’s new List is great for iOS and multiplatform apps, but doesn’t seem to be designed for desktop-specific apps which can do with much more information-dense UIs.\nSwiftUI has the newer Table too, but it’s also quite limited at this stage. For example, I don’t think it’s possible to make an entire row clickable.\nThis left me wanting to try out the much more battle-tested NSTableView – but as an Apple dev noob, I couldn’t get a minimal example up and running after a few hours of tinkering!\n… So here’s a snippet you can copy paste.1 Keep reading below if you’d like to see how it works step-by-step.\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct TableView: NSViewRepresentable {\n    class Coordinator: NSObject, NSTableViewDelegate, NSTableViewDataSource {\n        let data = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\"]\n\n        func numberOfRows(in tableView: NSTableView) -&gt; Int {\n            data.count\n        }\n\n        func tableView(_ tableView: NSTableView, viewFor tableColumn: NSTableColumn?, row: Int) -&gt; NSView? {\n            NSTextField(labelWithString: data[row])\n        }\n    }\n\n    func makeCoordinator() -&gt; Coordinator {\n        Coordinator()\n    }\n\n    func makeNSView(context: Context) -&gt; NSTableView {\n        let tableView = NSTableView()\n        tableView.delegate = context.coordinator\n        tableView.dataSource = context.coordinator\n        tableView.addTableColumn(NSTableColumn())\n        return tableView\n    }\n\n    func updateNSView(_ nsView: NSTableView, context: Context) {\n        // Do nothing\n    }\n}\nStep-by-step:\nCreate your table view struct, conforming to NSViewRepresentable. This is a standard way of using AppKit/UIKit views in your SwiftUI applications.\nIn makeNSView, create the NSTableView with a single column, and leave updateNSView blank for now:\nstruct TableView: NSViewRepresentable {\n    func makeNSView(context: Context) -&gt; NSTableView {\n        let tableView = NSTableView()\n        tableView.addColumn(NSTableColumn())\n        return tableView\n    }\n\n    func updateNSView(_ nsView: NSTableView, context: Context) {\n        // Do nothing\n    }\n}\nCreate a Coordinator, subclassing:\n\nNSTableViewDelegate which we’ll use to customize how cells are rendered as views, and\nNSTableViewDataSource to define the number of rows.\n\nImplement makeCoordinator, returning an instance of Coordinator, then link it to the table view in makeNSView:\nstruct TableView: NSViewRepresentable {\n    class Coordinator: NSObject, NSTableViewDelegate, NSTableViewDataSource {\n    }\n\n    func makeCoordinator() -&gt; Coordinator {\n        Coordinator()\n    }\n\n    func makeNSView(context: Context) -&gt; NSTableView {\n        let tableView = NSTableView()\n        tableView.delegate = context.coordinator\n        tableView.dataSource = context.coordinator\n        tableView.addColumn(NSTableColumn())\n        return tableView\n    }\n\n    func updateNSView(_ nsView: NSTableView, context: Context) {\n        // Do nothing\n    }\n}\nYou still won’t see anything being rendered yet, since we still need to implement NSTableViewDelegate and NSTableViewDataSource methods.\nFor this minimal example, we’ll use a simple static array of strings defined right in the coordinator, although in practice you would probably get data from the view.\nImplement NSTableViewDataSource’s numberOfRows and NSTableViewDelegate’s tableView(tableView:viewFor:row). The former returns the length of our array. The latter returns an NSTextField created from the corresponding row of data.\n    class Coordinator: NSObject, NSTableViewDelegate, NSTableViewDataSource {\n        let data = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\"]\n\n        func numberOfRows(in tableView: NSTableView) -&gt; Int {\n            data.count\n        }\n\n        func tableView(_ tableView: NSTableView, viewFor tableColumn: NSTableColumn?, row: Int) -&gt; NSView? {\n            NSTextField(labelWithString: data[row])\n        }\n    }\nThat’s it! This is the minimal implementation of an NSTableView in SwiftUI that I could find. Let me know on Twitter, via email, or via the GitHub discussion below if you have any comments or suggestions.\nHere are some next steps I have in mind:\n\nGet preview working (this looks helpful)\nCustom cell view\n\nVertically align text\n\nMultiple columns\n\nIndex column\nImage column\nDate column\n\nColumn headers\nMake it interactive\n\nDo something on select\nDo something on hover\nDo something on click\n\nLoad data dynamically\n\nLet me know if you’d find these helpful!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany thanks to Alex Grebenyuk whose article and repo I heavily referenced to figure this out.↩︎"

You directly execute JavaScript code against the IPython API that creates a code cell, sets the text of the cell (which must be base64 encoded), then executes it:\n\nimport base64\nfrom IPython.display import Javascript\nfrom ipywidgets import Button\n\ndef create_code_cell():\n    code = \"print('Hello world!')\"\n    encoded_code = base64.b64encode(code.encode()).decode()\n    display(Javascript(f'''\n        var code = IPython.notebook.insert_cell_below('code');\n        code.set_text(atob(\"{encoded_code}\"));\n        code.execute();\n    '''))\n\ncreate_code_cell()\n\n\n\n\n\nprint('Hello world!')\n\nHello world!\n\n\nI didn’t know that there was a neat JavaScript API inside Jupyter notebooks, but it does make sense that it exists.

The callback is expected to be a function accepting a single argument, button, to which the button object itself is passed - although we won’t be using it. We need to know the path that was clicked on as well, so we’ll have to partial that in later:\n\ndef on_click_dir(path, button): create_code_cell(f\"ls('{path}')\")\ndef on_click_file(path, button): create_code_cell(f\"Path('{path}')\")\n\nTest if it works:\n\non_click_file(Path('point-and-click-directory-navigation-inside-a-jupyter-notebook.ipynb'), None)\n\n\n\n\n\nPath('point-and-click-directory-navigation-inside-a-jupyter-notebook.ipynb')\n\nPosixPath('point-and-click-directory-navigation-inside-a-jupyter-notebook.ipynb')\n\n\nNeat!

You can also check out the demo video in my tweet.\nIf you pay close attention to the demo video, you’ll notice that it’s still styled slightly differently to what we’ve built here. Some styles can’t be changed through ipywidget’s style interface, so that was achieved by manually writing CSS with the %%html magic command followed by a &lt;style&gt;...&lt;/style&gt; tag, and then assigning a class to the buttons and boxes using their add_class method. I also implemented a custom widget with a small render JavaScript function that resized the output grid until it fit the width of the screen.\nI’m really excited with how this turned out! And it was far simpler than I’d expected. I’ll definitely be exploring the point-and-click navigation pattern more. I’m thinking about trying it out for exploring documentation about Python objects."

Decades of hard work by some of the brightest minds have enabled us to create and distribute incredible AI-powered products from almost anywhere in the world.\nIn this post, I show you how to build your own vector search engine.\nBy the end of the post you’ll be able to search through a dataset of pet images for queries as obscure as “a fluffy pink cat on a tv” – and it’ll work! You’ll also have a concrete idea of how to structure and deploy your own search engine.\nWe’ll get there in three parts:"

    "section": "Part 1: Background",
    "text": "Part 1: Background\n\nWhy do we need vector search?\nI built Meepo out of frustration with existing search engines. I needed a fork, so naturally I tried to search for “fork” on my favourite online store, but the result contained only 4 items – none of which resemble a fork at all!\n\nIt turns out, I had to search “cutlery” instead, because that’s how the items happen to be tagged in the store’s catalogue.\nOn the other hand, here are the first few results with Meepo. So many forks!\n\nWhy the difference?\nWhereas conventional search engines work by matching the text in your query with labels attached to each image, modern semantic search engines leverage neural networks for a deeper understanding of what’s represented by the pixels in the image and the text in their labels.\nThis means that queries like “fork” work, regardless of how each item is labelled. It also means that you can get far more creative with your queries, including colors, textures, patterns, and more!\nFor example, here is the top search result for “fluffy striped salmon pillow”:\n\n\n\n\n\nIncredible! And even more incredible is how easy it is to build your own such vector search engine thanks to a powerful and open-source technology: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP).\n\n\nWhat’s CLIP?\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a technique for training neural networks with state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on a variety of tasks using mixed image and text data.11 While CLIP has been dethroned several times in the last two years (most recently by BLIP-2), it is still notable for introducing a step change improvement in the power of zero-shot multimodal techniques.\nZero-shot learning refers to a machine learning approach where a model is trained on one dataset and then tested on a completely different dataset. For instance, CLIP was trained on a broad dataset of captioned images from the web. However, in the next section we will apply it to a dataset featuring only cats and dogs. Meepo similarly applies CLIP to images of homeware and fashion items.\n\n\n\nA visualization of the contrastive language-image pretraining approach. Source: CLIP: Connecting Text and Images by OpenAI.\n\n\nThe idea is to pretrain a neural network to predict the most relevant text snippet given an image and vice versa.\nBut the trick is to use a contrastive rather than a predictive objective.\nWhat does that mean?\nA predictive objective takes an input image and tries to predict its corresponding text snippet.\nOn the other hand, a contrastive objective predicts a vector for each image and another vector for each text snippet; these vectors are called embeddings. It does so in such a way that corresponding image and text vectors are more similar (according to some chosen similarity function) and non-corresponding image and text vectors are less similar.\nOpenAI found that a contrastive objective reached the same zero-shot ImageNet accuracy as the predictive objective while using 4x fewer training examples!\n\n\nConVIRT: The little-known medical roots of CLIP\nInterestingly, the technique described above was originally introduced as ConVIRT (Zhang et al. 2020), which demonstrated the approach on 217k medical image-text pairs (~2000x fewer than CLIP).\n\n\n\nX-ray images with naturally occurring paired descriptions from doctor’s reports. Source: Figure 1 of Zhang et al., 2020\n\n\nDespite being acknowledged in the CLIP paper, I hadn’t heard of ConVIRT until I read the CLIP paper myself:\n\n[…] we create a new dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs and demonstrate that a simplified version of ConVIRT trained from scratch, which we call CLIP, for Contrastive Language-image Pre-training, is an efficient method of learning from natural language supervision.\n\nAs with most machine learning innovations, it all starts with data. High-quality annotations of medical images are expensive to make.\nConVIRT’s key insight was to mine doctor’s reports in their natural language format for image-text pairs.\nOpenAI’s later contribution was largely an engineering effort. They scaled ConVIRT up to a 2000x larger dataset—400 million examples in total! Of course, that itself is a mighty task.\nNow that we have some background on CLIP and its impressive zero-shot capabilities, how do we actually use it to create a semantic search engine like Meepo?"

    "text": "Part 2: Let’s build a CLIP search engine for the Oxford Pets dataset\nIn this section, we’ll build our own CLIP-based semantic search engine on the Oxford Pets dataset.\nI chose the Oxford Pets dataset since it’s a good size and complexity to demonstrate the power of CLIP, but I urge you to try this out on your own dataset too.\nWe’ll do this in two steps:\n\nFirst, we’ll use CLIP as a convenient zero-shot classifier.\nThen we’ll show how to use the same underlying functions for text-to-image search.\n\nBy the end of the section you will be able to search for queries as obscure as “a fluffy pink cat on a tv” – and it’ll work!\n\nThe Oxford Pets dataset\nFirst install these required libraries:\n\nHuggingFace Datasets: easily access and share datasets for a variety of machine learning tasks.\nHuggingFace Transformers: easily download, train, and use state-of-the-art pretrained neural networks.\n\n\n!pip install datasets transformers\n\nThen load the Oxford Pets dataset – thanks to Pedro Cuenqa for uploading it:\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\ndataset = load_dataset(\"pcuenq/oxford-pets\")\n\nOne of the most important rules of machine learning is to always look at the data. This is quite easy with images, since we can just show the image.\nLet’s define a helper function to show thumbnails of an image:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef thumbnail(image, scale=3):\n    return image.resize(np.array(image.size)//scale)\n\nHere’s an example of a cat:\n\ncat_row = dataset['train'][15]\ncat_image = cat_row['image']\nthumbnail(cat_image)\n\n\n\n\n… and here’s an example of a dog:\n\ndog_row = dataset['train'][10]\ndog_image = dog_row['image']\nthumbnail(dog_image)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing CLIP for zero-shot classification\nNow that we have a dataset, we can load the CLIP processor and model. The concept of having a separate processor and model is central to the HuggingFace Transformers library, since it allows us to use 174 state-of-the-art models (as of writing this article) with a very similar API.\nNote that it might take a minute to download the pretrained weights:\n\nfrom transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel\n\nprocessor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained(\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\")\nmodel = CLIPModel.from_pretrained(\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\")\n\nThe CLIPProcessor prepares the inputs for the CLIPModel which can then be used to obtain embedding vectors. Let’s create a function to embed an image by first passing it through the processor and then into the model:\n\nimport torch\n\ndef embed_image(images):\n    if not isinstance(images, list): images = [images]\n    inputs = processor(images=images, return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True)\n    with torch.no_grad(): return model.get_image_features(**inputs)\n\nTest that it works:\n\nimages = [cat_image, dog_image]\nimage_embs = embed_image(images)\nimage_embs.shape\n\ntorch.Size([2, 512])\n\n\nYou can also pass text to the CLIPProcessor. Let’s create a similar function to embed text inputs:\n\ndef embed_text(text):\n    inputs = processor(text=text, return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True)\n    with torch.no_grad(): return model.get_text_features(**inputs)\n\n\ntext_embs = embed_text([f\"a photo of a {cls}\" for cls in [\"cat\", \"dog\"]])\ntext_embs.shape\n\ntorch.Size([2, 512])\n\n\nWe can now use embeddings for zero-shot classification by using text inputs that represent the different classes, and then calculating the cosine similarity between image embeddings and text embeddings.\nCosine similarity is calculated by taking the dot product of normalized vectors:\n\ndef normalize(a): return a / a.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)\ndef cosine_sim(a, b): return normalize(a) @ normalize(b).T\n\n\ncosine_sim(image_embs, text_embs)\n\ntensor([[0.2639, 0.2127],\n        [0.1962, 0.2553]])\n\n\nNote how the similarity between the cat image and the text “a photo of a cat” (0.2639) is higher than the similarity between the cat image and the text “a photo of a dog” (0.2127), and similarly for the dog image in the next row of the tensor.\nWe can convert these similarities to probabilities by using the model’s logit_scale parameter followed by the softmax method:\n\ndef logits(a, b): return model.logit_scale.exp() * cosine_sim(a, b)\ndef probs(a, b): return logits(a, b).softmax(dim=0)\n\n\nprobs(text_embs, image_embs)\n\ntensor([[0.9940, 0.0027],\n        [0.0060, 0.9973]], grad_fn=&lt;SoftmaxBackward0&gt;)\n\n\nWe see a probability of 0.994 that the image of a cat is in fact a cat, and a probability of 0.997 that the image of a dog is in fact a dog. Pretty good!\nSince this is a zero-shot classifier, we can very easily generalize it to arbitrary classes! Let’s make a convenient wrapper to do exactly that:\n\ndef classify(image, classes, template=\"a photo of a {}\"):\n    image_embs = embed_image(image)\n    text_embs = embed_text([template.format(o) for o in classes])\n    return probs(text_embs, image_embs)\n\nTo use this, simply pass in a list of classes. You can also customize the template, which can improve the classification accuracy.\nHere’s how we can classify the breed of a cat:\n\ncat_breeds = sorted({row[\"label\"] for row in dataset[\"train\"] if not row[\"dog\"]})\nscores = classify(cat_image, cat_breeds, \"a photo of a {} cat\")\nscores\n\ntensor([[1.2116e-05],\n        [5.4131e-06],\n        [4.6950e-02],\n        [1.9504e-06],\n        [2.1754e-02],\n        [1.7998e-04],\n        [9.0918e-04],\n        [9.1228e-01],\n        [1.7194e-02],\n        [4.6431e-05],\n        [5.8636e-04],\n        [7.8781e-05]], grad_fn=&lt;SoftmaxBackward0&gt;)\n\n\n\nidx = torch.argmax(scores)\ncat_breeds[idx], scores[idx].item()\n\n('Persian', 0.9122824668884277)\n\n\n… and here’s how we can classify the color of any animal:\n\nclasses = [\"black\", \"white\", \"red\", \"green\", \"yellow\", \"blue\", \"brown\", \"orange\", \"pink\", \"purple\", \"grey\"]\nscores = classify(cat_image, classes, \"a photo of a {} animal\")\nidx = torch.argmax(scores)\nclasses[idx], scores[idx].item()\n\n('white', 0.8672362565994263)\n\n\nIt works – and it’s super convenient too!\n\n\nUsing CLIP for text-to-image search\nUsing CLIP for search is not too different from using it for zero-shot classification. In fact, search is even simpler! We don’t need to calculate probabilities since we ultimately only care about the order of items:\n\ndef search(image_embs, query_embs):\n    sims = cosine_sim(image_embs, query_embs).flatten()\n    indices = sims.argsort(descending=True)\n    return indices, sims[indices]\n\n\nindices, sims = search(image_embs, embed_text(\"a photo of a cat\"))\nindices, sims\n\n(tensor([0, 1]), tensor([0.2639, 0.1962]))\n\n\n\nfor i in indices: display(thumbnail(images[i]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s try that with a bigger dataset and some more interesting queries:\nLet’s embed all of the images. Since this took quite a while on my laptop (19 minutes), it’s convenient to cache the result to disk so that we don’t slow down iteration in our notebook:\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm\n\n\nall_image_embs_path = Path(\"oxford_pets_embeddings.npy\")\nif all_image_embs_path.exists():\n    all_image_embs = torch.tensor(np.load(all_image_embs_path))\nelse:\n    all_image_embs = [embed_image(row['image']) for row in tqdm(dataset['train'])]\n    np.save(all_image_embs_path, embs)\n\n\nall_image_embs.shape\n\ntorch.Size([7390, 512])\n\n\n\ndef search_and_display(image_embs, query_embs, k=3):\n    indices, _ = search(image_embs, query_embs)\n    for i in indices[:k]:\n        image = dataset[\"train\"][i.item()][\"image\"]\n        display(thumbnail(image))\n\n\nsearch_and_display(all_image_embs, embed_text(\"a photo of a white puppey on the grass\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing! I wonder how obscure we can get?\n\nsearch_and_display(all_image_embs, embed_text(\"a photo of a fluffy pink cat on a tv\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt always surprises me how well this works! 🤯\nAnd once again, it’s super flexible. For example, all we need to change in order to use an image query is to pass the image’s embeddings instead of text embeddings!\nLet’s find the most similar images to our fluffy white persian cat from earlier:\n\nsearch_and_display(all_image_embs, embed_image(cat_image))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have a working CLIP-based vector search engine, how do we share it with the world?"

    "text": "Part 3: Tips for deploying your search engine\nIn this section, I’ll share a few tips that you might find helpful in deploying your own search engine based on my experience with Meepo.\n\nHow Meepo works\nMeepo consists of the following two sub-systems:\n\nData pipeline: A set of scripts responsible for maintaining the data that powers the search engine. This includes scraping, running images through CLIP, and maintaining the data storage components (detailed further below).\nWeb app: A simple search form in front of a CLIP-based search engine (as described in part 2). The app reads from the application database and vector search index (written to by the data pipeline), and renders HTML/CSS to the user.\n\n\nData storage consists of two components that are updated by the data pipeline and then read from by the web app:\n\nApplication database: A typical relational database that contains all of the products in the search catalogue, along with associated metadata.\nVector search index: An index for fast approximate nearest neighbour vector search. I used faiss, although there are other options like hnswlib, as well as more full-featured vector search databases like Milvus, Pinecone, Qdrant, and Weaviate.\n\n\nTech stack\nAs for the specific tech choices, here’s the full stack powering Meepo:\n\nContrastive language-image pretraining: the deep learning method powering Meepo’s search.\nFaiss: a fast approximate nearest neighbour vector search index.\nConda: a Python package management system.\nnbdev: a platform for developing software using Jupyter notebooks.\nTailwind CSS: a simpler CSS framework.\nDaisyUI: a component library built on Tailwind CSS.\nSQLite: a light but powerful database engine.\nDjango: a battle-tested Python web framework.\nGunicorn: a Python HTTP server that lets us serve our Django application.\nNginx: a powerful and customizeable web server.\nCron: a job scheduler built into Unix operating systems.\nLinode: a cloud hosting provider.\n\n\n\nInfrastructure\nI developed and tested an MVP locally on a small subset of data. Once I was happy with that, I deployed it to a Linode 4 GB Shared CPU VPS (2 CPUs, 4GB RAM, 80GB storage) costing $24 per month, and subscribed to Linode’s backup service for an additional $5 per month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy use a Virtual Private Server(VPS) instead of a modern platform as a service option?\n\n\n\nMost people underestimate how much traffic you can serve from a single low cost VPS!\nPieter Levels, a well-known solopreneur, ran more than 40 of his websites serving over 250 million requests per month from a single VPS.\nMarginalia, an indie search engine that focuses on non-commercial content, casually handled the front page of Hackernews with a single server worth ~$5k of commercial hardware in their living room.\nMy good friend Ashton Hudson took the same approach with Serval, a price tracker for South Africa’s largest online store, which serves 3000 daily active users and stores 7 million time series data points on low cost servers at a total of ~$45 per month.\n\n\nI totally overestimated how much effort it would take to setup a VPS. It wasn’t that bad and took a few hours in the end. Here’s how I went about it. Note that these steps only need to be carried out once per server:\n\nRent a VPS: There are plenty of options available. I chose Linode for no particular reason.\nSetup your VPS: This includes updating packages, setting the timezone and hostname, creating a limited user, and tightening SSH settings. I followed this Linode guide.\nSetup nginx: I followed this Real Python guide.\n\nOnce your server is setup, you’ll need to follow a few more setups for your app (and each future app you create):\n\nSetup Gunicorn: I followed the same Real Python guide from above.\nSetup your domain name: Buy a domain name and configure your VPS to use it. I searched for the cheapest name containing “meepo” and was lucky to score meepo.shop at $2!\nDeploy your web app: I followed Django’s official deployment guide.\nDeploy your pipeline: I kept it simple and added a crontab entry to a single shell script.\n\n\n\n\nChoosing boring tech\nYou might have noticed that I chose a “boring” tech stack. I believe that boring tech is a key part of what allowed me to ship Meepo so quickly. Let me explain.\n\nIt’s boring because it works\nIt’s been around for decades. If that’s the case, and it’s still widely used, then it probably works! It might not be the most elegant solution, but it gets the job done. Software that’s been maintained for a long time is software that’s been hardened against many thousands of obscure edge-cases that users like you and I no longer have to worry about.\nFor example, Meepo is a Django application, and Django is 20 years old. That’s 20 years of incremental improvements and bug fixes resulting in a truly robust piece of software.\n\n\nInnovate on your process, not only your tech\nDevelopers typically enjoy learning new tools. That’s a good thing, but it also means that we’re biased to choosing new tools even when they aren’t necessarily improvements over the status quo.\nInstead of focusing on learning a new tool, try focusing on mastering tools you already know, and developing excellent decision-making skills on top of those tools with a ruthless focus on shipping quickly.\nFor me, this meant using Django instead of something like FastAPI, and using a simple Linux VPS instead of a more modern platform as a service option. But this is different for everyone and depends on each person’s individual experience.\n\n\nDeviating from what works\nOf course, absolute rules are rarely a good idea in any domain as complex as software. There are definitely cases where less boring tech can be a good idea – I try to have a very specific reason before deviating from my favorite boring tools.\nFor example, I developed Meepo entirely in Jupyter notebooks. It sounds crazy, I know! But there’s something about notebook-driven development that I can’t quite shake. It makes programming feel like a game. There’s constant feedback, very quick iteration cycles, and everything is within reach: code, rich docs, and tests all in one place. In fact, the second part of this post was based on the same notebooks that run Meepo.\n\n\n\nBeing a responsible digital citizen\nIf I’m scraping a website, I’m most likely not the website’s intended audience, so I try very hard not to negatively impact the user experience of their intended audience.\nLegal concerns around web scraping are pretty vague. However, as long as you provide value to the underlying service, they probably won’t mind you scraping them. For example, nobody cares that Google scrapes their sites because they provide traffic via search. Similarly, fashion stores that Meepo scrapes probably won’t mind the extra traffic it brings them.\nHere are some more detailed tips for scraping responsibly:\n\nCheck how big the viewership of the website is. I would personally be hesitant to scrape a small website and would probably prefer to email the owner directly.\nIdentify yourself with contact information via the user agent header – don’t try to fake being a human! A simple pattern you can use is your.website.com/x.y (your@email.com) where x.y is your scraper’s version number.\nBe considerate about their resource usage, especially since you aren’t their intended audience.\nDo the bulk of your requests during off-peak times depending on the local timezone of their audience.\nSleep between requests as much as you possibly can. Add small random amounts as well to reduce the likelihood of overlapping with other scheduled scrapers and bots, thus reducing peak load.\nUse compression when scraping plain text or JSON to minimise their outgoing traffic. It doesn’t work nearly as well for images so it’s probably best to not compress them to avoid extra CPU usage on their servers."

    "text": "I’ve been thinking a lot about what it means to Do Important Work, and there two quotes in particular that have stuck with me.\nThe first is from Visa’s The Prestige Trap. With his classic wit and charm, Visa breaks the problem down in the opening sentence:\n\nI’ve had several conversations with friends who’ve been incapacitated by the burdensome bullshit obligation to Have A Meaningful Life / Be Remembered / Do Important Work.\n\nAnd though the details differ, the second is a tweet from Michael Nielsen that I think is closely related:\n\nI try particularly to push back on the efficiency mindset with work (where it’s strongest). Asking “What’s a much more enjoyable way” to achieve some outcome (even if inefficient) has been very good for me. Amusingly, though not the point, it often makes the work much better too\n\nI think they’re very much speaking about the same thing. Many of us want to Do Important Work, including, in my opinion, Michael and Visa. That’s fine. A natural follow-up is to try to make it concrete with a question: What important work can I do?\nBut here’s the problem. Measuring the importance or meaning of an action is really hard. I’m not sure it’s even possible. From a pragmatic perspective, we might say that important work is recognised through reward, perhaps monetary. But, as Visa reminds us, ‘nobody really knows what the world needs! The world itself doesn’t quite know either, often until on hindsight!’.\nSo what do we do instead? Well, what seems to have worked empirically is to ‘enjoy the piddling’. To be playful and curious. To prefer the more enjoyable way. Feynman, Jobs, Wozniak, and Newton are all examples cited by Visa. It’s okay to want to Do Important Work. I think both Michael and Visakan really do want that. And I know I do. The trick is to rejig the way that you think about it away from the destructive default to a more constructive, and amusingly efficient alternative. I’m delighted by the similarity between Visa’s and Michael’s descriptions:\n\nVisa: Wonderfully, it seems to me that lots of people who end up Doing Important Work often got there by being playful and curious.\n\n\nMichael: Amusingly, though not the point, it often makes the work much better too.\n\nIt really is both wonderful and amusing. It feels like the gist of a koan: to Do Important Work, you must forget about Doing Important Work."

    "text": "I attended JupyterCon 2023 in Paris two weeks ago. On Thursday, Hamel Husain, myself, and J. J. Allaire (as a teaching assistant) presented a two and a half hour tutorial on Writing, Documenting, Testing, and Distributing Python Packages with nbdev and Quarto.\nI think it went well! The room was full and attendees engaged with great questions.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the tutorial website taken with shot-scraper.\n\n\nHamel opened by describing the roots of nbdev’s programming paradigm: a combination of literate programming (introduced by Donald Knuth) and exploratory programming (beautifully demonstrated by Bret Victor) made possible by Jupyter notebooks. He then took us through both basic and advanced usage of Quarto – the publishing platform that powers nbdev’s documentation generation.\nI followed with a demonstration of how I do notebook-driven development by live coding the now classic nbdev example: a library for interacting with playing cards based on Chapter 18 of Allen B. Downey’s Think Python. I tried to focus on the thinking process and how it differs from more conventional programming paradigms, rather than focusing on the mechanics of how nbdev works since that is so readily available online.\nMy demonstration was largely based on the official written nbdev tutorial and best practices post. I also used the tutorial as an opportunity to refine these docs. The biggest refinement was that I now recommend JupyterLab instead of the classic notebook. There are two main reasons for this:\n\nLab has a growing extension ecosystem:\n\nI can’t live without the wonderful jupyterlab-quarto. It renders Quarto markdown including frontmatter, callouts, and fenced divs which greatly improves the authoring experience.\nThere is interesting work being done on LLM-related extensions like jupyter-ai which adds an LLM chat interface to the sidebar.\n\nLab 4.0.0 was released! It comes with significantly better performance among a ton of other improvements. Most notably for me is a built-in implementation of classic’s collapsible headings extension (including the keyboard shortcuts). However, it is worth noting that extensions will need to migrate to version 4 and I’m not sure what this process will look like!\n\nYou can also find an outline of the tutorial as well as the slides for Hamel’s opening section at the tutorial website: https://fastai.github.io/jupytercon-2023.\nBy the way, we wrote the tutorial site using Quarto too! Here is the underlying repo: https://github.com/fastai/jupytercon-2023.\nThe conference venue was beautiful! On the last day, David Brochart, Hamel Husain, and I took a walk around the Cité des sciences et de l’industrie and surrounding area, and David shared some of the fascinating history behind the city.\n\n\n\nDavid Brochart, Hamel Husain, and myself pictured in front of the Philharmonie de Paris a short walk away from the JupyterCon 2023 conference hall."

I’ve always loved games, and making things. Unsurprisingly, my foray into programming started with making games.\nAfter vigorous searching for game making software, with my favourite search engine at the time, AltaVista, which some of you may remember, I found a program called Game Maker.\nIt had a GUI, where you created game objects and programmed logic into them with buttons. It also had scripting capabilities. But I didn’t dare to delve into them.\n\n\n\n\n\nEventually, a cousin of mine introduced me to a more powerful tool. A programming language called DarkBASIC, a form of the language, BASIC.\nIt had a nice editor, a built-in command line interface. I think the 1 and 2 on the top right corresponded to tabs. And it allowed you to create 3D games.\n\n\n\n\n\nI then moved on to some of the more “real” programming languages. I dabbled in C++.\nI was taught Java in high school.\nAnd finally, I settled on Python. I think the reason I hopped so often from one language to the next, was because I was never quite satisfied with how it “felt” to program in these languages. I was never truly comfortable with the way I had to translate what I thought into what I typed. Until Python."

    "text": "Why learn APL?\n[Jeremy gave a personal answer here. I’ve paraphrased here and there, and reframed it in the third person, hopefully without changing his intended meaning.]\n\nAPL is a way into learning and teaching math\nMath is beautiful… but also very frustrating. It’s inconsistent, the notation is hard to lookup, and it’s hard to understand what things mean in a very abstract way when we can’t experiment with them. APL helps us understand math, thus it helps us teach math.\nJeremy teaches his daughter and her friend math. He found that there were concepts that he found very difficult to teach in traditional abstract ways. In particular, he spent an hour trying to teach them sequences and series with very little progress. He then tried it again with numpy and APL and it clicked much more easily.\n\n\nThere’s emmense beauty and power in notations\nIn a previous live coding session, Jeremy talked about regex being a powerful notation. Powerful notations are key to furthering human intellectual development. You see this repeatedly in many domains, particularly math and physics. New ideas take hundreds of years to figure out become far simpler once someone finds the right notation. Notations grant us the ability to manipulate symbols to develop new ideas. Examples include algebra, zero, and even juggling!\nAPL is a very powerful notation, not just for math but for a range of topics that use similar concepts as math. For example, Aaron Hsu’s PhD used APL to build a compiler on the GPU.\n\n\nAPL will challenge you to think about programming in new ways\nAPL is an independently developed branch of programming with a rich history. APL as a notation has been developed since the 1960s, largely independently to other branches of programming languages. If you never learn about it, you miss out on an entire branch of languages with an incredibly rich history. Jeremy felt that learning array programming did more for his programming skills than any other language he’s learned."

For example, &lt;backtick&gt;2 is a shortcut for the ¯ glyph. You can type &lt;backtick&gt;&lt;space&gt; to enter a normal backtick again. It also adds a bar to the top of the page with all of the possible glyphs:\n\n\n\nThe APL langauge bar: a horizontal list of APL gylphs.\n\n\nHovering on a glyph shows a its name and keyboard shortucts:\n\n\n\nHovering on the minus sign glyph shows ‘negate minus’."

    "section": "A top-down learning plan",
    "text": "A top-down learning plan\nMost tutorials teach APL bottom-up; they go really deep into one topic. FastAI instead strives for top-down teaching. Therefore, we’ll try the approach of learning all of the glyphs first, as simply and quickly as we can. This has the added benefit that the documentation will become useable, since one glyph’s documentation often contains examples that use other glyphs.\nYou can find a table of all of the gylphs here:\n\n\n\nTables of APL glyphs: primitive functions, and primitive operators, via Dyalog docs.\n\n\nA good way to learn new concepts in APL (and in general) is to look at an example, try to predict what it’ll do before you run it, then run it and compare with your prediction. APL documentation is filled with examples which makes this approach even more powerful. The documentation will often include multiple examples as separate elements of an array.\nFor example, you should read the example for negate:\n\n- 3.2 ¯7 0\n\n¯3.2 7 0\n\n\n\nas three examples:\n\n- 3.2\n\n¯3.2\n\n\n\n\n- ¯7\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n- 0\n\n0\n\n\n\nWe then went on to learn about the following. My notes are sparse at this point - I highly recommend you check out the video instead!\n\nMinus sign; its monadic (negate) and dyadic (minus; subtract) forms.\n\nWe also use operator names when reading APL expressions. For example, ¯2 reads “negate 2”.\n\nArrays - we needed to know about arrays to understand minus’ examples.\n\nIn APL you create an array (like a vector in math and a tensor in deep learning) by adding spaces between elements.\n\nFunctions; monadic versus dyadic functions.\n\nEach glyph has two forms: monadic and dyadic. This isn’t the same as “monads” in Haskell - it simply means a function that takes one argument. In APL you don’t write functions like f(x,y,z). You either write them as f x if there’s one argument (monadic), or x f y if there are two (dyadic).\n\nPlus sign; its monadic (conjugate) and dyadic (plus) forms.\nComplex numbers - we needed to know about complex numbers to understand conjugate."

For now, initiate the cursor at (0, 0), then render the stdscr cursor at the current position. Don’t add any movement functionality just yet.\nSolution. Create a Cursor class with attributes row and col, both default to 0. Instantiate a Cursor in main, and call stdscr.move to the current cursor position in the main loop:\n# ...\n\nclass Cursor:\n    def __init__(self, row=0, col=0):\n        self.row = row\n        self.col = col\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    window = Window(curses.LINES - 1, curses.COLS - 1)\n    cursor = Cursor()\n\n    while True:\n        stdscr.erase()\n        for row, line in enumerate(buffer[:window.n_rows]):\n            stdscr.addstr(row, 0, line[:window.n_cols])\n        stdscr.move(cursor.row, cursor.col)\n\n# ...\nThe cursor should now be displayed at (0, 0).\nProblem 5. Next, add cursor movement. Define a method for each direction: up, down, left, and right, each of which update the row or col as required. Then map the arrow keys to these cursor movement methods in the main loop.\nSolution.\n# ... class Cursor:\n\n    def up(self):\n        self.row -= 1\n\n    def down(self):\n        self.row += 1\n\n    def left(self):\n        self.col -= 1\n\n    def right(self):\n        self.col += 1\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n        k = stdscr.getkey()\n        if k == \"q\":\n            sys.exit(0)\n        elif k == \"KEY_UP\":\n            cursor.up()\n        elif k == \"KEY_DOWN\":\n            cursor.down()\n        elif k == \"KEY_LEFT\":\n            cursor.left()\n        elif k == \"KEY_RIGHT\":\n            cursor.right()\n\n# ...\nRerun the application and give it a spin. It works great! Until…\nProblem 6. It crashes when you try to move outside of the screen. We should probably restrict the cursor within the buffer.\n(You may have already solved this in your solution to Problem 5. If so, well done, and feel free to skip ahead!)\nSolution. Update the movement methods to only move if they’ll remain within the buffer. Since cursor movement now depends on buffer properties, we also need to pass the buffer through as an argument:\n# ... class Cursor:\n\n    def up(self):\n        if self.row &gt; 0:\n            self.row -= 1\n\n    def down(self, buffer):\n        if self.row &lt; len(buffer) - 1:\n            self.row += 1\n\n    def left(self):\n        if self.col &gt; 0:\n            self.col -= 1\n\n    def right(self, buffer):\n        if self.col &lt; len(buffer[self.row]):\n            self.col += 1\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n        k = stdscr.getkey()\n        if k == \"q\":\n            sys.exit(0)\n        elif k == \"KEY_UP\":\n            cursor.up()\n        elif k == \"KEY_DOWN\":\n            cursor.down(buffer)\n        elif k == \"KEY_LEFT\":\n            cursor.left()\n        elif k == \"KEY_RIGHT\":\n            cursor.right(buffer)\n\n# ...\nProblem 7. Almost there. Cursor movement should now mostly work, except that when moving to a shorter line the cursor will float outside the buffer. Fix that.\nSolution. Restrict the cursor’s col to be within the line we move to:\n# ... class Cursor:\n\n    def up(self, buffer):\n        if self.row &gt; 0:\n            self.row -= 1\n            self._clamp_col(buffer)\n\n    def down(self, buffer):\n        if self.row &lt; len(buffer) - 1:\n            self.row += 1\n            self._clamp_col(buffer)\n\n    def _clamp_col(self, buffer):\n        self.col = min(self.col, len(buffer[self.row]))\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n        k = stdscr.getkey()\n        if k == \"q\":\n            sys.exit(0)\n        elif k == \"KEY_UP\":\n            cursor.up(buffer)\n        # ...\n\n# ...\nProblem 8. This works alright, but it’s not the most convenient. Often when you move to a shorter line and back to the original line, you mean for the cursor to be as it was before you moved at all. Implement this functionality.\nSolution. We can achieve this by introducing a new variable, _col_hint, that keeps track of the last col explicitly moved to, and instead use that to reset the column after line movements.\nWhenever col is set by a horizontal movement, it should also update _col_hint to the same value. That value should be used when clamping. We can use a property and property setter to implement that.\n# ...\n\nclass Cursor:\n    def __init__(self, row=0, col=0, col_hint=None):\n        self.row = row\n        self._col = col\n        self._col_hint = col if col_hint is None else col_hint\n\n    @property\n    def col(self):\n        return self._col\n\n    @col.setter\n    def col(self, col):\n        self._col = col\n        self._col_hint = col\n\n    # ...\n\n    def _clamp_col(self, buffer):\n        self._col = min(self._col_hint, len(buffer[self.row]))\n\n# ...\nNote that _clamp_col sets the internal variable _col directly, avoiding the setter thus not resetting _col_hint.\nProblem 9. There’s one final addition that should also improve the user experience. If the cursor is moved horizontally outside the buffer, wrap to the start (or end) of the next (or previous) line.\nSolution.\n# ... class Cursor:\n\n    def left(self, buffer):\n        if self.col &gt; 0:\n            self.col -= 1\n        elif self.row &gt; 0:\n            self.row -= 1\n            self.col = len(buffer[self.row])\n\n    def right(self, buffer):\n        if self.col &lt; len(buffer[self.row]):\n            self.col += 1\n        elif self.row &lt; len(buffer) - 1:\n            self.row += 1\n            self.col = 0\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n        elif k == \"KEY_LEFT\":\n            cursor.left(buffer)\n\n# ...\nGive it a spin. All should work well except when the cursor moves outside of the window."

Worse still, we can also move the cursor outside of the window! Scroll the window vertically as the cursor moves. Don’t worry about horizontal scrolling for now.\nSolution. Add row and col attributes to the Window that track the current position of the window as it scrolls through the buffer (specifically, the position of the top-left of the window). Then add methods to scroll the window vertically.\nHaving learned from cursor movement, we’ll be sure to do the necessary checks the first time round: only scroll up if we’re not already at the top of the buffer and if the cursor exceeds the top of the window, and similarly for downward scrolling. In the main loop, scroll the window after moving the cursor. And finally, update where we start slicing the buffer when rendering.\n# ...\n\nclass Window:\n\n    def __init__(self, n_rows, n_cols, row=0, col=0):\n        self.n_rows = n_rows\n        self.n_cols = n_cols\n        self.row = row\n        self.col = col\n\n    @property\n    def bottom(self):\n        return self.row + self.n_rows - 1\n\n    def up(self, cursor):\n        if cursor.row == self.row - 1 and self.row &gt; 0:\n            self.row -= 1\n\n    def down(self, buffer, cursor):\n        if cursor.row == self.bottom + 1 and self.bottom &lt; len(buffer) - 1:\n            self.row += 1\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    while True:\n        stdscr.erase()\n        for row, line in enumerate(buffer[window.row:window.row + window.n_rows]):\n            stdscr.addstr(row, 0, line)\n        stdscr.move(cursor.row, cursor.col)\n\n# ...\n        elif k == \"KEY_UP\":\n            cursor.up()\n            window.up(cursor)\n        elif k == \"KEY_DOWN\":\n            cursor.down(buffer)\n            window.down(buffer, cursor)\n        elif k == \"KEY_LEFT\":\n            cursor.left()\n            window.up(cursor)\n        elif k == \"KEY_RIGHT\":\n            cursor.right(buffer)\n            window.down(buffer, cursor)\n# ...\nNote that left and right movement may require vertical scrolling since the cursor may be wrapped to the previous or next line.\nThe last crucial piece is to translate the cursor’s actual position, which is in terms of the buffer, to be in terms of what’s displayed: the window. Add a translate method to the window, and use it to render the cursor:\n# ... class Window:\n\n    def translate(self, cursor):\n        return cursor.row - self.row, cursor.col - self.col\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    while True:\n        stdscr.erase()\n        for row, line in enumerate(buffer[window.row:window.row + window.n_rows]):\n            stdscr.addstr(row, 0, line)\n        stdscr.move(*window.translate(cursor))\n\n# ...\nProblem 11. We’ve addressed vertical scrolling, but long lines still present an issue. There are two ways we might address long lines. We could either scroll the entire window with the cursor, as we did for vertical scrolling. This is how most editors work. Or we could scroll only the selected line to follow the cursor, which as far as I know is only implemented by nano. Let’s implement the second approach.\nThe desired behaviour is that when the cursor exceeds some margin away from the right edge of the window, the window should be moved one page to the right, and similarly for the left side.\nSolution. Add a horizontal_scroll method to Window that implements this, and call it after any cursor movements in the main loop.\n# ... class Window:\n\n    def horizontal_scroll(self, cursor, left_margin=5, right_margin=2):\n        n_pages = cursor.col // (self.n_cols - right_margin)\n        self.col = max(n_pages * self.n_cols - right_margin - left_margin, 0)\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n        elif k == \"KEY_UP\":\n            cursor.up()\n            window.up(cursor)\n            window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)\n        elif k == \"KEY_DOWN\":\n            cursor.down(buffer)\n            window.down(buffer, cursor)\n            window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)\n        elif k == \"KEY_LEFT\":\n            cursor.left()\n            window.up(cursor)\n            window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)\n        elif k == \"KEY_RIGHT\":\n            cursor.right(buffer)\n            window.down(buffer, cursor)\n            window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)\n\n# ...\nNext, update how the buffer renders long lines by including characters that indicate that a given line has more content on the left («) or right (»).\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    while True:\n        stdscr.erase()\n        for row, line in enumerate(buffer[window.row:window.row + window.n_rows]):\n            if row == cursor.row - window.row and window.col &gt; 0:\n                line = \"«\" + line[window.col + 1:]\n            if len(line) &gt; window.n_cols:\n                line = line[:window.n_cols - 1] + \"»\"\n            stdscr.addstr(row, 0, line)\n        stdscr.move(*window.translate(cursor))\n\n    # ..."

    "text": "Edit the buffer\nAnd now to the key ingredient, actually editing text!\nStart by adding a Buffer class that wraps the list of lines. Implement __len__ and __getitem__ so that any dependents of buffer needn’t change. Set buffer to a Buffer instance instead of the current list of lines.\n# ...\n\nclass Buffer:\n    def __init__(self, lines):\n        self.lines = lines\n\n    def __len__(self):\n        return len(self.lines)\n\n    def __getitem__(self, index):\n        return self.lines[index]\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n    parser.add_argument(\"filename\")\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    with open(args.filename) as f:\n        buffer = Buffer(f.read().splitlines())\n\n# ...\nNow’s a good time for a tiny refactor: extract len(buffer) - 1 to the Buffer.bottom property. You might argue that this isn’t worth being extracted. My reasoning is that the last column in a line is len(buffer[row]) whereas the last row in a buffer is len(buffer) - 1, and I can never get it right the first time!\nI think it’s good to be aware of the kinds of bugs you tend to introduce, rather than to always follow a dogmatic approach. It also has a nice symmetry with Window.bottom, though that’s less important. It might be worth considering doing similar for len(buffer[row]), but I find that easy to remember and already concise.\n# ... class Buffer:\n\n    @property\n    def bottom(self):\n        return len(self) - 1\n\n# ... class Cursor:\n\n    def down(self, buffer):\n        if self.row &lt; buffer.bottom:\n            self.row += 1\n            self._clamp_col(buffer)\n\n    # ...\n\n    def right(self, buffer):\n        if self.col &lt; len(buffer[self.row]):\n            self.col += 1\n        elif self.row &lt; buffer.bottom:\n            self.row += 1\n            self.col = 0\n\n# ... class Window:\n\n    def down(self, buffer, cursor):\n        if cursor.row == self.bottom + 1 and self.bottom &lt; buffer.bottom:\n            self.row += 1\n\n# ...\nWe’ll be adding three methods to the buffer: insert, split, and delete.\n\nInsert a string into the buffer\nProblem 12. If an unmapped key is pressed, insert it into the buffer at the current cursor position.\nSolution.\nSince the buffer stores text as a list of lines, and the cursor moves through a two-dimensional space, there’s a tiny bit of work we need to do to insert text at a given cursor.\nPop the line under the cursor, split it at the cursor, and concatenate the before part, the string to be inserted, and the after part. Insert the concatenated string into the buffer at the cursor. And as usual, call the method in the main loop. This case differs slightly from previous, in that we’ll map all unmapped keys to Buffer.insert. That’s probably not ideal, for example, a user might enter Ctrl-i which will write ^I to the buffer, but it’ll do for now.\n# ... class Buffer:\n\n    def insert(self, cursor, string):\n        row, col = cursor.row, cursor.col\n        current = self.lines.pop(row)\n        new = current[:col] + string + current[col:]\n        self.lines.insert(row, new)\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    if k == \"q\":\n        sys.exit(0)\n    # ...\n    else:\n        buffer.insert(cursor, k)\n\n# ...\nTest it out. It’ll insert text, but won’t move the cursor after the inserted text. All we need to do is move right for each inserted character. Since we already have a command to move the cursor right (and scroll the window as needed), now’s the time to extract a right function and re-use it:\n# ...\n\ndef right(window, buffer, cursor):\n    cursor.right(buffer)\n    window.down(buffer, cursor)\n    window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    elif k == \"KEY_RIGHT\":\n        right(window, buffer, cursor)\n    # ...\n    else:\n        buffer.insert(cursor, k)\n        for _ in k:\n            right(window, buffer, cursor)\n\n# ...\n\n\nSplit a line in the buffer\nProbem 12. If you hit enter, you won’t get the expected result, which is to split the line at the cursor.\nSolution. Implement split as below, similar to insert.\n# ... class Buffer:\n\n    def split(self, cursor):\n        row, col = cursor.row, cursor.col\n        current = self.lines.pop(row)\n        self.lines.insert(row, current[:col])\n        self.lines.insert(row + 1, current[col:])\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    elif k == \"\\n\":\n        buffer.split(cursor)\n        right(window, buffer, cursor)\n\n# ...\n\n\nDelete a character from the buffer\nProblem 13. As in the previous section, hitting delete or backspace won’t give the expected result. Start by implementing a delete command, bound to the delete key, that deletes the character under the cursor.\nSolution. Add a delete method. If the cursor is at the last position in the buffer, don’t do anything. Otherwise, there are two options. Either the cursor is inside a line, then follow similar logic to insert but instead of adding a string remove a character. Or the cursor is at the end of the line, then join the current line to the next.\n# ... class Buffer:\n\n    def delete(self, cursor):\n        row, col = cursor.row, cursor.col\n        if (row, col) &lt; (self.bottom, len(self[row])):\n            current = self.lines.pop(row)\n            if col &lt; len(self[row]):\n                new = current[:col] + current[col + 1:]\n                self.lines.insert(row, new)\n            else:\n                next = self.lines.pop(row)\n                new = current + next\n                self.lines.insert(row, new)\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    elif k in (\"KEY_DELETE\", \"\\x04\"):\n        buffer.delete(cursor)\n\n# ...\nOn MacOS, curses doesn’t correctly decode the backspace and delete keys, they’re instead returned as \\x7f and \\x04 respectively. I haven’t found a satisfactory answer for why this is the case. If you know, I’d love to hear!\nProblem 14. Implement backspace.\nSolution. Backspace can be implemented by moving left and then deleting. Just as we extracted a right function for insertion, we’ll extract a left function here:\n# ...\n\ndef left(window, buffer, cursor):\n    cursor.left(buffer)\n    window.up(cursor)\n    window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    elif k in (\"KEY_BACKSPACE\", \"\\x7f\"):\n        if (cursor.row, cursor.col) &gt; (0, 0):\n            left(window, buffer, cursor)\n            buffer.delete(cursor)\n\n# ...\nAnd look at that! You’ve built a minimal yet functional text editor.\nProblem 15. There’s one key piece of functionality still missing: saving the edited file. I’ll leave that as the final unsolved problem."

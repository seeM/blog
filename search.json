    "text": "Why learn APL?\n[Jeremy gave a personal answer here. I’ve paraphrased here and there, and reframed it in the third person, hopefully without changing his intended meaning.]\n\nAPL is a way into learning and teaching math\nMath is beautiful… but also very frustrating. It’s inconsistent, the notation is hard to lookup, and it’s hard to understand what things mean in a very abstract way when we can’t experiment with them. APL helps us understand math, thus it helps us teach math.\nJeremy teaches his daughter and her friend math. He found that there were concepts that he found very difficult to teach in traditional abstract ways. In particular, he spent an hour trying to teach them sequences and series with very little progress. He then tried it again with numpy and APL and it clicked much more easily.\n\n\nThere’s emmense beauty and power in notations\nIn a previous live coding session, Jeremy talked about regex being a powerful notation. Powerful notations are key to furthering human intellectual development. You see this repeatedly in many domains, particularly math and physics. New ideas take hundreds of years to figure out become far simpler once someone finds the right notation. Notations grant us the ability to manipulate symbols to develop new ideas. Examples include algebra, zero, and even juggling!\nAPL is a very powerful notation, not just for math but for a range of topics that use similar concepts as math. For example, Aaron Hsu’s PhD used APL to build a compiler on the GPU.\n\n\nAPL will challenge you to think about programming in new ways\nAPL is an independently developed branch of programming with a rich history. APL as a notation has been developed since the 1960s, largely independently to other branches of programming languages. If you never learn about it, you miss out on an entire branch of languages with an incredibly rich history. Jeremy felt that learning array programming did more for his programming skills than any other language he’s learned."

The first step is to install Dyalog from their download page.\n\n\nInstall the Dyalog Jupyter kernel\nAlthough Dyalog comes with an IDE, we’ll use Jupyter notebooks.

To make these easier to type in your notebook, you might want to use the APL language bar. It lets you use backtick (`) as a prefix to enter glyphs. For example, &lt;backtick&gt;2 is a shortcut for the ¯ glyph. You can type &lt;backtick&gt;&lt;space&gt; to enter a normal backtick again. It also adds a bar to the top of the page with all of the possible glyphs:\n\n\n\nThe APL langauge bar: a horizontal list of APL gylphs.\n\n\nHovering on a glyph shows a its name and keyboard shortucts:\n\n\n\nHovering on the minus sign glyph shows ‘negate minus’."

    "title": "Notes from the fast.ai APL study group",
    "section": "A top-down learning plan",
    "text": "A top-down learning plan\nMost tutorials teach APL bottom-up; they go really deep into one topic. FastAI instead strives for top-down teaching. Therefore, we’ll try the approach of learning all of the glyphs first, as simply and quickly as we can. This has the added benefit that the documentation will become useable, since one glyph’s documentation often contains examples that use other glyphs.\nYou can find a table of all of the gylphs here:\n\n\n\nTables of APL glyphs: primitive functions, and primitive operators, via Dyalog docs.\n\n\nA good way to learn new concepts in APL (and in general) is to look at an example, try to predict what it’ll do before you run it, then run it and compare with your prediction. APL documentation is filled with examples which makes this approach even more powerful. The documentation will often include multiple examples as separate elements of an array.\nFor example, you should read the example for negate:\n\n- 3.2 ¯7 0\n\n¯3.2 7 0\n\n\n\nas three examples:\n\n- 3.2\n\n¯3.2\n\n\n\n\n- ¯7\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n- 0\n\n0\n\n\n\nWe then went on to learn about the following. My notes are sparse at this point - I highly recommend you check out the video instead!\n\nMinus sign; its monadic (negate) and dyadic (minus; subtract) forms.\n\nWe also use operator names when reading APL expressions. For example, ¯2 reads “negate 2”.\n\nArrays - we needed to know about arrays to understand minus’ examples.\n\nIn APL you create an array (like a vector in math and a tensor in deep learning) by adding spaces between elements.\n\nFunctions; monadic versus dyadic functions.\n\nEach glyph has two forms: monadic and dyadic. This isn’t the same as “monads” in Haskell - it simply means a function that takes one argument. In APL you don’t write functions like f(x,y,z). You either write them as f x if there’s one argument (monadic), or x f y if there are two (dyadic).\n\nPlus sign; its monadic (conjugate) and dyadic (plus) forms.\nComplex numbers - we needed to know about complex numbers to understand conjugate."

    "text": "My journey from Game Maker to Python \n\n\n\n\n\nGood morning everyone, my name is Wasim.\nA little background. I started programming when I was in primary school. I’ve always loved games, and making things. Unsurprisingly, my foray into programming started with making games.\nAfter vigorous searching for game making software, with my favourite search engine at the time, AltaVista, which some of you may remember, I found a program called Game Maker.\nIt had a GUI, where you created game objects and programmed logic into them with buttons. It also had scripting capabilities. But I didn’t dare to delve into them.\n\n\n\n\n\nEventually, a cousin of mine introduced me to a more powerful tool. A programming language called DarkBASIC, a form of the language, BASIC.\nIt had a nice editor, a built-in command line interface. I think the 1 and 2 on the top right corresponded to tabs. And it allowed you to create 3D games.\n\n\n\n\n\nI then moved on to some of the more “real” programming languages. I dabbled in C++.\nI was taught Java in high school.\nAnd finally, I settled on Python. I think the reason I hopped so often from one language to the next, was because I was never quite satisfied with how it “felt” to program in these languages. I was never truly comfortable with the way I had to translate what I thought into what I typed. Until Python."

I’ve seen pipes before, and that, my friend, is a pipe.”\nWell, you can’t pack this with tobacco and smoke it. This is a painting of a pipe, an image, a representation, but its not the pipe itself.\nAt this point, you might be wondering: What does this have to do with code?

This is some very simple dplyr code.\nWhat I do when I read (or write) code like this, is to translate it to and from English. I don’t think “df percent greater than percent…”"

For now, initiate the cursor at (0, 0), then render the stdscr cursor at the current position. Don’t add any movement functionality just yet.\nSolution. Create a Cursor class with attributes row and col, both default to 0. Instantiate a Cursor in main, and call stdscr.move to the current cursor position in the main loop:\n# ...\n\nclass Cursor:\n    def __init__(self, row=0, col=0):\n        self.row = row\n        self.col = col\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    window = Window(curses.LINES - 1, curses.COLS - 1)\n    cursor = Cursor()\n\n    while True:\n        stdscr.erase()\n        for row, line in enumerate(buffer[:window.n_rows]):\n            stdscr.addstr(row, 0, line[:window.n_cols])\n        stdscr.move(cursor.row, cursor.col)\n\n# ...\nThe cursor should now be displayed at (0, 0).\nProblem 5. Next, add cursor movement. Define a method for each direction: up, down, left, and right, each of which update the row or col as required. Then map the arrow keys to these cursor movement methods in the main loop.\nSolution.\n# ... class Cursor:\n\n    def up(self):\n        self.row -= 1\n\n    def down(self):\n        self.row += 1\n\n    def left(self):\n        self.col -= 1\n\n    def right(self):\n        self.col += 1\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n        k = stdscr.getkey()\n        if k == \"q\":\n            sys.exit(0)\n        elif k == \"KEY_UP\":\n            cursor.up()\n        elif k == \"KEY_DOWN\":\n            cursor.down()\n        elif k == \"KEY_LEFT\":\n            cursor.left()\n        elif k == \"KEY_RIGHT\":\n            cursor.right()\n\n# ...\nRerun the application and give it a spin. It works great! Until…\nProblem 6. It crashes when you try to move outside of the screen. We should probably restrict the cursor within the buffer.\n(You may have already solved this in your solution to Problem 5. If so, well done, and feel free to skip ahead!)\nSolution. Update the movement methods to only move if they’ll remain within the buffer. Since cursor movement now depends on buffer properties, we also need to pass the buffer through as an argument:\n# ... class Cursor:\n\n    def up(self):\n        if self.row &gt; 0:\n            self.row -= 1\n\n    def down(self, buffer):\n        if self.row &lt; len(buffer) - 1:\n            self.row += 1\n\n    def left(self):\n        if self.col &gt; 0:\n            self.col -= 1\n\n    def right(self, buffer):\n        if self.col &lt; len(buffer[self.row]):\n            self.col += 1\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n        k = stdscr.getkey()\n        if k == \"q\":\n            sys.exit(0)\n        elif k == \"KEY_UP\":\n            cursor.up()\n        elif k == \"KEY_DOWN\":\n            cursor.down(buffer)\n        elif k == \"KEY_LEFT\":\n            cursor.left()\n        elif k == \"KEY_RIGHT\":\n            cursor.right(buffer)\n\n# ...\nProblem 7. Almost there. Cursor movement should now mostly work, except that when moving to a shorter line the cursor will float outside the buffer. Fix that.\nSolution. Restrict the cursor’s col to be within the line we move to:\n# ... class Cursor:\n\n    def up(self, buffer):\n        if self.row &gt; 0:\n            self.row -= 1\n            self._clamp_col(buffer)\n\n    def down(self, buffer):\n        if self.row &lt; len(buffer) - 1:\n            self.row += 1\n            self._clamp_col(buffer)\n\n    def _clamp_col(self, buffer):\n        self.col = min(self.col, len(buffer[self.row]))\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n        k = stdscr.getkey()\n        if k == \"q\":\n            sys.exit(0)\n        elif k == \"KEY_UP\":\n            cursor.up(buffer)\n        # ...\n\n# ...\nProblem 8. This works alright, but it’s not the most convenient. Often when you move to a shorter line and back to the original line, you mean for the cursor to be as it was before you moved at all. Implement this functionality.\nSolution. We can achieve this by introducing a new variable, _col_hint, that keeps track of the last col explicitly moved to, and instead use that to reset the column after line movements.\nWhenever col is set by a horizontal movement, it should also update _col_hint to the same value. That value should be used when clamping. We can use a property and property setter to implement that.\n# ...\n\nclass Cursor:\n    def __init__(self, row=0, col=0, col_hint=None):\n        self.row = row\n        self._col = col\n        self._col_hint = col if col_hint is None else col_hint\n\n    @property\n    def col(self):\n        return self._col\n\n    @col.setter\n    def col(self, col):\n        self._col = col\n        self._col_hint = col\n\n    # ...\n\n    def _clamp_col(self, buffer):\n        self._col = min(self._col_hint, len(buffer[self.row]))\n\n# ...\nNote that _clamp_col sets the internal variable _col directly, avoiding the setter thus not resetting _col_hint.\nProblem 9. There’s one final addition that should also improve the user experience. If the cursor is moved horizontally outside the buffer, wrap to the start (or end) of the next (or previous) line.\nSolution.\n# ... class Cursor:\n\n    def left(self, buffer):\n        if self.col &gt; 0:\n            self.col -= 1\n        elif self.row &gt; 0:\n            self.row -= 1\n            self.col = len(buffer[self.row])\n\n    def right(self, buffer):\n        if self.col &lt; len(buffer[self.row]):\n            self.col += 1\n        elif self.row &lt; len(buffer) - 1:\n            self.row += 1\n            self.col = 0\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n        elif k == \"KEY_LEFT\":\n            cursor.left(buffer)\n\n# ...\nGive it a spin. All should work well except when the cursor moves outside of the window."

    "text": "Scroll the window to the cursor\nProblem 10. We currently have no way of seeing any part of the buffer that’s outside the window. Worse still, we can also move the cursor outside of the window! Scroll the window vertically as the cursor moves. Don’t worry about horizontal scrolling for now.\nSolution. Add row and col attributes to the Window that track the current position of the window as it scrolls through the buffer (specifically, the position of the top-left of the window). Then add methods to scroll the window vertically.\nHaving learned from cursor movement, we’ll be sure to do the necessary checks the first time round: only scroll up if we’re not already at the top of the buffer and if the cursor exceeds the top of the window, and similarly for downward scrolling. In the main loop, scroll the window after moving the cursor. And finally, update where we start slicing the buffer when rendering.\n# ...\n\nclass Window:\n\n    def __init__(self, n_rows, n_cols, row=0, col=0):\n        self.n_rows = n_rows\n        self.n_cols = n_cols\n        self.row = row\n        self.col = col\n\n    @property\n    def bottom(self):\n        return self.row + self.n_rows - 1\n\n    def up(self, cursor):\n        if cursor.row == self.row - 1 and self.row &gt; 0:\n            self.row -= 1\n\n    def down(self, buffer, cursor):\n        if cursor.row == self.bottom + 1 and self.bottom &lt; len(buffer) - 1:\n            self.row += 1\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    while True:\n        stdscr.erase()\n        for row, line in enumerate(buffer[window.row:window.row + window.n_rows]):\n            stdscr.addstr(row, 0, line)\n        stdscr.move(cursor.row, cursor.col)\n\n# ...\n        elif k == \"KEY_UP\":\n            cursor.up()\n            window.up(cursor)\n        elif k == \"KEY_DOWN\":\n            cursor.down(buffer)\n            window.down(buffer, cursor)\n        elif k == \"KEY_LEFT\":\n            cursor.left()\n            window.up(cursor)\n        elif k == \"KEY_RIGHT\":\n            cursor.right(buffer)\n            window.down(buffer, cursor)\n# ...\nNote that left and right movement may require vertical scrolling since the cursor may be wrapped to the previous or next line.\nThe last crucial piece is to translate the cursor’s actual position, which is in terms of the buffer, to be in terms of what’s displayed: the window. Add a translate method to the window, and use it to render the cursor:\n# ... class Window:\n\n    def translate(self, cursor):\n        return cursor.row - self.row, cursor.col - self.col\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    while True:\n        stdscr.erase()\n        for row, line in enumerate(buffer[window.row:window.row + window.n_rows]):\n            stdscr.addstr(row, 0, line)\n        stdscr.move(*window.translate(cursor))\n\n# ...\nProblem 11. We’ve addressed vertical scrolling, but long lines still present an issue. There are two ways we might address long lines. We could either scroll the entire window with the cursor, as we did for vertical scrolling. This is how most editors work. Or we could scroll only the selected line to follow the cursor, which as far as I know is only implemented by nano. Let’s implement the second approach.\nThe desired behaviour is that when the cursor exceeds some margin away from the right edge of the window, the window should be moved one page to the right, and similarly for the left side.\nSolution. Add a horizontal_scroll method to Window that implements this, and call it after any cursor movements in the main loop.\n# ... class Window:\n\n    def horizontal_scroll(self, cursor, left_margin=5, right_margin=2):\n        n_pages = cursor.col // (self.n_cols - right_margin)\n        self.col = max(n_pages * self.n_cols - right_margin - left_margin, 0)\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n        elif k == \"KEY_UP\":\n            cursor.up()\n            window.up(cursor)\n            window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)\n        elif k == \"KEY_DOWN\":\n            cursor.down(buffer)\n            window.down(buffer, cursor)\n            window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)\n        elif k == \"KEY_LEFT\":\n            cursor.left()\n            window.up(cursor)\n            window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)\n        elif k == \"KEY_RIGHT\":\n            cursor.right(buffer)\n            window.down(buffer, cursor)\n            window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)\n\n# ...\nNext, update how the buffer renders long lines by including characters that indicate that a given line has more content on the left («) or right (»).\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    while True:\n        stdscr.erase()\n        for row, line in enumerate(buffer[window.row:window.row + window.n_rows]):\n            if row == cursor.row - window.row and window.col &gt; 0:\n                line = \"«\" + line[window.col + 1:]\n            if len(line) &gt; window.n_cols:\n                line = line[:window.n_cols - 1] + \"»\"\n            stdscr.addstr(row, 0, line)\n        stdscr.move(*window.translate(cursor))\n\n    # ..."

    "text": "Edit the buffer\nAnd now to the key ingredient, actually editing text!\nStart by adding a Buffer class that wraps the list of lines. Implement __len__ and __getitem__ so that any dependents of buffer needn’t change. Set buffer to a Buffer instance instead of the current list of lines.\n# ...\n\nclass Buffer:\n    def __init__(self, lines):\n        self.lines = lines\n\n    def __len__(self):\n        return len(self.lines)\n\n    def __getitem__(self, index):\n        return self.lines[index]\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n    parser.add_argument(\"filename\")\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    with open(args.filename) as f:\n        buffer = Buffer(f.read().splitlines())\n\n# ...\nNow’s a good time for a tiny refactor: extract len(buffer) - 1 to the Buffer.bottom property. You might argue that this isn’t worth being extracted. My reasoning is that the last column in a line is len(buffer[row]) whereas the last row in a buffer is len(buffer) - 1, and I can never get it right the first time!\nI think it’s good to be aware of the kinds of bugs you tend to introduce, rather than to always follow a dogmatic approach. It also has a nice symmetry with Window.bottom, though that’s less important. It might be worth considering doing similar for len(buffer[row]), but I find that easy to remember and already concise.\n# ... class Buffer:\n\n    @property\n    def bottom(self):\n        return len(self) - 1\n\n# ... class Cursor:\n\n    def down(self, buffer):\n        if self.row &lt; buffer.bottom:\n            self.row += 1\n            self._clamp_col(buffer)\n\n    # ...\n\n    def right(self, buffer):\n        if self.col &lt; len(buffer[self.row]):\n            self.col += 1\n        elif self.row &lt; buffer.bottom:\n            self.row += 1\n            self.col = 0\n\n# ... class Window:\n\n    def down(self, buffer, cursor):\n        if cursor.row == self.bottom + 1 and self.bottom &lt; buffer.bottom:\n            self.row += 1\n\n# ...\nWe’ll be adding three methods to the buffer: insert, split, and delete.\n\nInsert a string into the buffer\nProblem 12. If an unmapped key is pressed, insert it into the buffer at the current cursor position.\nSolution.\nSince the buffer stores text as a list of lines, and the cursor moves through a two-dimensional space, there’s a tiny bit of work we need to do to insert text at a given cursor.\nPop the line under the cursor, split it at the cursor, and concatenate the before part, the string to be inserted, and the after part. Insert the concatenated string into the buffer at the cursor. And as usual, call the method in the main loop. This case differs slightly from previous, in that we’ll map all unmapped keys to Buffer.insert. That’s probably not ideal, for example, a user might enter Ctrl-i which will write ^I to the buffer, but it’ll do for now.\n# ... class Buffer:\n\n    def insert(self, cursor, string):\n        row, col = cursor.row, cursor.col\n        current = self.lines.pop(row)\n        new = current[:col] + string + current[col:]\n        self.lines.insert(row, new)\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    if k == \"q\":\n        sys.exit(0)\n    # ...\n    else:\n        buffer.insert(cursor, k)\n\n# ...\nTest it out. It’ll insert text, but won’t move the cursor after the inserted text. All we need to do is move right for each inserted character. Since we already have a command to move the cursor right (and scroll the window as needed), now’s the time to extract a right function and re-use it:\n# ...\n\ndef right(window, buffer, cursor):\n    cursor.right(buffer)\n    window.down(buffer, cursor)\n    window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    elif k == \"KEY_RIGHT\":\n        right(window, buffer, cursor)\n    # ...\n    else:\n        buffer.insert(cursor, k)\n        for _ in k:\n            right(window, buffer, cursor)\n\n# ...\n\n\nSplit a line in the buffer\nProbem 12. If you hit enter, you won’t get the expected result, which is to split the line at the cursor.\nSolution. Implement split as below, similar to insert.\n# ... class Buffer:\n\n    def split(self, cursor):\n        row, col = cursor.row, cursor.col\n        current = self.lines.pop(row)\n        self.lines.insert(row, current[:col])\n        self.lines.insert(row + 1, current[col:])\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    elif k == \"\\n\":\n        buffer.split(cursor)\n        right(window, buffer, cursor)\n\n# ...\n\n\nDelete a character from the buffer\nProblem 13. As in the previous section, hitting delete or backspace won’t give the expected result. Start by implementing a delete command, bound to the delete key, that deletes the character under the cursor.\nSolution. Add a delete method. If the cursor is at the last position in the buffer, don’t do anything. Otherwise, there are two options. Either the cursor is inside a line, then follow similar logic to insert but instead of adding a string remove a character. Or the cursor is at the end of the line, then join the current line to the next.\n# ... class Buffer:\n\n    def delete(self, cursor):\n        row, col = cursor.row, cursor.col\n        if (row, col) &lt; (self.bottom, len(self[row])):\n            current = self.lines.pop(row)\n            if col &lt; len(self[row]):\n                new = current[:col] + current[col + 1:]\n                self.lines.insert(row, new)\n            else:\n                next = self.lines.pop(row)\n                new = current + next\n                self.lines.insert(row, new)\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    elif k in (\"KEY_DELETE\", \"\\x04\"):\n        buffer.delete(cursor)\n\n# ...\nOn MacOS, curses doesn’t correctly decode the backspace and delete keys, they’re instead returned as \\x7f and \\x04 respectively. I haven’t found a satisfactory answer for why this is the case. If you know, I’d love to hear!\nProblem 14. Implement backspace.\nSolution. Backspace can be implemented by moving left and then deleting. Just as we extracted a right function for insertion, we’ll extract a left function here:\n# ...\n\ndef left(window, buffer, cursor):\n    cursor.left(buffer)\n    window.up(cursor)\n    window.horizontal_scroll(cursor)\n\n# ... def main(stdscr):\n\n    elif k in (\"KEY_BACKSPACE\", \"\\x7f\"):\n        if (cursor.row, cursor.col) &gt; (0, 0):\n            left(window, buffer, cursor)\n            buffer.delete(cursor)\n\n# ...\nAnd look at that! You’ve built a minimal yet functional text editor.\nProblem 15. There’s one key piece of functionality still missing: saving the edited file. I’ll leave that as the final unsolved problem."

With his classic wit and charm, Visa breaks the problem down in the opening sentence:\n\nI’ve had several conversations with friends who’ve been incapacitated by the burdensome bullshit obligation to Have A Meaningful Life / Be Remembered / Do Important Work.\n\nAnd though the details differ, the second is a tweet from Michael Nielsen that I think is closely related:\n\nI try particularly to push back on the efficiency mindset with work (where it’s strongest). Asking “What’s a much more enjoyable way” to achieve some outcome (even if inefficient) has been very good for me. Amusingly, though not the point, it often makes the work much better too\n\nI think they’re very much speaking about the same thing. Many of us want to Do Important Work, including, in my opinion, Michael and Visa. That’s fine. A natural follow-up is to try to make it concrete with a question: What important work can I do?\nBut here’s the problem. Measuring the importance or meaning of an action is really hard. I’m not sure it’s even possible. From a pragmatic perspective, we might say that important work is recognised through reward, perhaps monetary. But, as Visa reminds us, ‘nobody really knows what the world needs! The world itself doesn’t quite know either, often until on hindsight!’.\nSo what do we do instead? Well, what seems to have worked empirically is to ‘enjoy the piddling’. To be playful and curious. To prefer the more enjoyable way. Feynman, Jobs, Wozniak, and Newton are all examples cited by Visa. It’s okay to want to Do Important Work. I think both Michael and Visakan really do want that. And I know I do. The trick is to rejig the way that you think about it away from the destructive default to a more constructive, and amusingly efficient alternative. I’m delighted by the similarity between Visa’s and Michael’s descriptions:\n\nVisa: Wonderfully, it seems to me that lots of people who end up Doing Important Work often got there by being playful and curious.\n\n\nMichael: Amusingly, though not the point, it often makes the work much better too.\n\nIt really is both wonderful and amusing. It feels like the gist of a koan: to Do Important Work, you must forget about Doing Important Work."

You directly execute JavaScript code against the IPython API that creates a code cell, sets the text of the cell (which must be base64 encoded), then executes it:\n\nimport base64\nfrom IPython.display import Javascript\nfrom ipywidgets import Button\n\ndef create_code_cell():\n    code = \"print('Hello world!')\"\n    encoded_code = base64.b64encode(code.encode()).decode()\n    display(Javascript(f'''\n        var code = IPython.notebook.insert_cell_below('code');\n        code.set_text(atob(\"{encoded_code}\"));\n        code.execute();\n    '''))\n\ncreate_code_cell()\n\n\n\n\n\nprint('Hello world!')\n\nHello world!\n\n\nI didn’t know that there was a neat JavaScript API inside Jupyter notebooks, but it does make sense that it exists.

    "text": "I recently started learning macOS development using SwiftUI as part of my latest project: building a macOS Jupyter frontend. While I’m loving Swift (the language) and SwiftUI (the UI framework), it’s sometimes extremely difficult to find out information that feels like it should be readily available.\nThe latest such case is how to use an NSTableView in SwiftUI. SwiftUI’s new List is great for iOS and multiplatform apps, but doesn’t seem to be designed for desktop-specific apps which can do with much more information-dense UIs.\nSwiftUI has the newer Table too, but it’s also quite limited at this stage. For example, I don’t think it’s possible to make an entire row clickable.\nThis left me wanting to try out the much more battle-tested NSTableView – but as an Apple dev noob, I couldn’t get a minimal example up and running after a few hours of tinkering!\n… So here’s a snippet you can copy paste.1 Keep reading below if you’d like to see how it works step-by-step.\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct TableView: NSViewRepresentable {\n    class Coordinator: NSObject, NSTableViewDelegate, NSTableViewDataSource {\n        let data = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\"]\n\n        func numberOfRows(in tableView: NSTableView) -&gt; Int {\n            data.count\n        }\n\n        func tableView(_ tableView: NSTableView, viewFor tableColumn: NSTableColumn?, row: Int) -&gt; NSView? {\n            NSTextField(labelWithString: data[row])\n        }\n    }\n\n    func makeCoordinator() -&gt; Coordinator {\n        Coordinator()\n    }\n\n    func makeNSView(context: Context) -&gt; NSTableView {\n        let tableView = NSTableView()\n        tableView.delegate = context.coordinator\n        tableView.dataSource = context.coordinator\n        tableView.addTableColumn(NSTableColumn())\n        return tableView\n    }\n\n    func updateNSView(_ nsView: NSTableView, context: Context) {\n        // Do nothing\n    }\n}\nStep-by-step:\nCreate your table view struct, conforming to NSViewRepresentable. This is a standard way of using AppKit/UIKit views in your SwiftUI applications.\nIn makeNSView, create the NSTableView with a single column, and leave updateNSView blank for now:\nstruct TableView: NSViewRepresentable {\n    func makeNSView(context: Context) -&gt; NSTableView {\n        let tableView = NSTableView()\n        tableView.addColumn(NSTableColumn())\n        return tableView\n    }\n\n    func updateNSView(_ nsView: NSTableView, context: Context) {\n        // Do nothing\n    }\n}\nCreate a Coordinator, subclassing:\n\nNSTableViewDelegate which we’ll use to customize how cells are rendered as views, and\nNSTableViewDataSource to define the number of rows.\n\nImplement makeCoordinator, returning an instance of Coordinator, then link it to the table view in makeNSView:\nstruct TableView: NSViewRepresentable {\n    class Coordinator: NSObject, NSTableViewDelegate, NSTableViewDataSource {\n    }\n\n    func makeCoordinator() -&gt; Coordinator {\n        Coordinator()\n    }\n\n    func makeNSView(context: Context) -&gt; NSTableView {\n        let tableView = NSTableView()\n        tableView.delegate = context.coordinator\n        tableView.dataSource = context.coordinator\n        tableView.addColumn(NSTableColumn())\n        return tableView\n    }\n\n    func updateNSView(_ nsView: NSTableView, context: Context) {\n        // Do nothing\n    }\n}\nYou still won’t see anything being rendered yet, since we still need to implement NSTableViewDelegate and NSTableViewDataSource methods.\nFor this minimal example, we’ll use a simple static array of strings defined right in the coordinator, although in practice you would probably get data from the view.\nImplement NSTableViewDataSource’s numberOfRows and NSTableViewDelegate’s tableView(tableView:viewFor:row). The former returns the length of our array. The latter returns an NSTextField created from the corresponding row of data.\n    class Coordinator: NSObject, NSTableViewDelegate, NSTableViewDataSource {\n        let data = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\"]\n\n        func numberOfRows(in tableView: NSTableView) -&gt; Int {\n            data.count\n        }\n\n        func tableView(_ tableView: NSTableView, viewFor tableColumn: NSTableColumn?, row: Int) -&gt; NSView? {\n            NSTextField(labelWithString: data[row])\n        }\n    }\nThat’s it! This is the minimal implementation of an NSTableView in SwiftUI that I could find. Let me know on Twitter, via email, or via the GitHub discussion below if you have any comments or suggestions.\nHere are some next steps I have in mind:\n\nGet preview working (this looks helpful)\nCustom cell view\n\nVertically align text\n\nMultiple columns\n\nIndex column\nImage column\nDate column\n\nColumn headers\nMake it interactive\n\nDo something on select\nDo something on hover\nDo something on click\n\nLoad data dynamically\n\nLet me know if you’d find these helpful!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nMany thanks to Alex Grebenyuk whose article and repo I heavily referenced to figure this out.↩︎"

    "text": "How Pelican works\nPelican’s highest-level of abstraction is its command-line interface, which you would typically use as follows:\n$ pelican content output -s pelicanconf.py\nThis would read all articles and pages in the content directory, convert them to HTML, render web pages with the relevant Jinja templates, and write the resulting static website to the output directory.\nThe rough flow to achieve this is as follows:\n\nInstantiate a list of Generators (which house all of the relevent Readers and a jinja Environment) and a Writer.\nFor each Generator:\n\nCall the generate_context method, which reads the input files, converts them to HTML, and adds the outputs to a context dictionary.\nCall the generate_output method, passing the Writer and context. This gets the relevant jinja Template from the Environment, renders it with the provided context, and writes the result to the final output directory.\n\n\nAs you can see, Generators are responsible for glueing together the lower-level components: Reader, jinja Template, and Writer. In order to understand each of these components, we’ll reimplement the core logic of a Generator from scratch!"

Jinja provides the Environment class for reusing functionality across templates so we’ll use that here.\nPelican searches for templates in the following order:\n\nIndividual template overrides, via settings['THEME_TEMPLATES_OVERRIDES'].\nThe configured theme, via settings['THEME'].\nThe default simple theme packaged with Pelican.\n\nWe can implement this search order using a FileSystemLoader, housed in an Environment for convenience:\n\nimport pelican\nfrom jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\ntemplate_paths = [*(Path(o) for o in settings['THEME_TEMPLATES_OVERRIDES']),\n                  Path(settings['THEME'])/'templates',\n                  Path(pelican.__file__).parent/'themes/simple/templates']\nenv = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader(template_paths),\n                  **settings['JINJA_ENVIRONMENT'])\n\nNow we can get the article template:\n\ntemplate = env.get_template('article.html')\n\nThe last step of preparation is to create the context dictionary that’s passed through to the Template to render the article:\n\nfrom pelican.contents import Article\n\ncontext = settings.copy()\narticle = Article(content, metadata, settings, post_filepath, context)\narticle.readtime = {'minutes': 1}  # NOTE: this is a workaround to support the readtime plugin that I use\ncontext['article'] = article\n\nAnd now we can write the final result!\n\nfrom pelican.writers import Writer\n\noutput_dir = root/'test'\nwriter = Writer(output_dir, settings)\nwriter.write_file(Path(post_filepath.name).with_suffix('.html'), template, context)\n\nLet’s read it back in and see what it looks like.

And that’s it, we’ve successfully rendered a blog post web page using Pelican’s low-level components!\nBefore we end off, clean up the files we made along the way:\n\nimport shutil\nshutil.rmtree(output_dir, ignore_errors=True)\npost_filepath.unlink(missing_ok=True)"

    "text": "import ipywidgets\nimport time\nfrom threading import Thread\n\nLet’s start with a very simple interface. An input text, a submit button, and an output text (disabled=True so that it’s not editable):\n\ninput_ = ipywidgets.Text(\"Hey ChatGPT, please summarise this text.\")\nbutton = ipywidgets.Button(description=\"Submit\")\noutput = ipywidgets.Text(disabled=True)\ndisplay(input_, button, output)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis won’t do anything yet. We need to setup an on_click callback first. We’ll fake a request to OpenAI that simply sleeps for half a second then returns a fixed string. Then we’ll update the output text’s value with the result:\n\ndef request_open_ai(prompt):\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    return \"Here's a summary of your text.\"\n\n\ndef update_output(text):\n    output.value = text\n\n\ndef on_click(button):\n    text = request_open_ai(input_.value)\n    update_output(text)\n\n\nbutton.on_click(on_click)\n\nIf you click “Submit” now, it should populate the output after half a second.\nIf we do this synchronously and in the main thread, the entire UI will hang during the requestOpenAi call. So instead, we can separate that call into another thread. I think ipywidgets already does a version of this for us. But if it didn’t, here’s a very rough version of how we’d do it:\n\nThread(target=request_open_ai, args=(input,)).run()\n\nBut then how do we get the result and update the output with it? It’s often trickier to pass data across threads. Instead, we define our request function so that it accepts a callback that gets called with the result:\n\ndef request_open_ai(prompt, on_completion):\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    on_completion(\"Here's a summary of your text.\")\n\n\ndef on_click(button):\n    Thread(target=request_open_ai, args=(input, update_output)).run()\n\n\ninput_ = ipywidgets.Text(\"Hey ChatGPT, please summarise this text.\")\nbutton = ipywidgets.Button(description=\"Submit\")\noutput = ipywidgets.Text(disabled=True)\nbutton.on_click(on_click)\ndisplay(input_, button, output)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis works okay, but starts to get very confusing as you add more and more nested callbacks. In fact, it can get so bad that it’s been nicknamed callback hell. Someone was so frustrated with it that they even created a website! This is where async/await becomes useful, since it looks a lot more like ordinary programming:\n\nimport asyncio\n\n\nasync def request_open_ai(prompt):\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    return \"Here's a summary of your text.\"\n\n\nasync def on_click(button):\n    text = await request_open_ai(input_.value)\n    update_output(text)\n\nNote how these functions look a lot similar to the original synchronous ones instead of having the weird callbacks.\nIn most UI frameworks, we’d be able to pass in an async function like the new on_click. I’m not sure how to do that with ipywidgets, so we need to define a little wrapper that synchronously calls the async function, so we can set it as the button’s on_click handler (confusing, I know):\n\ndef on_click_sync(button):\n    coroutine = on_click(button)\n    asyncio.ensure_future(coroutine)\n\n\ninput_ = ipywidgets.Text(\"Hey ChatGPT, please summarise this text.\")\nbutton = ipywidgets.Button(description=\"Submit\")\noutput = ipywidgets.Text(disabled=True)\nbutton.on_click(on_click_sync)\ndisplay(input_, button, output)"

The cell above this was created by calling on_click_file.\nFinally, we implement a straightforward minimal ls function using Button widgets for Paths, and wrapping those in a VBox widget:\n\nfrom ipywidgets import VBox\n\ndef ls(root=Path()):\n    if isinstance(root, str): root = Path(root).expanduser()\n    paths = sorted(root.iterdir())\n    if not paths: return\n    buttons = []\n    for path in paths:\n        button = Button(description=str(path))\n        button.on_click(partial(on_click_dir if path.is_dir() else on_click_file, path))\n        buttons.append(button)\n    return VBox(buttons)"

Some styles can’t be changed through ipywidget’s style interface, so that was achieved by manually writing CSS with the %%html magic command followed by a &lt;style&gt;...&lt;/style&gt; tag, and then assigning a class to the buttons and boxes using their add_class method. I also implemented a custom widget with a small render JavaScript function that resized the output grid until it fit the width of the screen.\nI’m really excited with how this turned out!

For those less familiar, this form of testing is common in projects that use nbdev.\nHere’s what actually happens:\n\nThe nbprocess_test command creates a ProcessPoolExecutor with some number of workers and tasks (each notebook being a separate task).\nWorker 1 processes one task, say task 1, which creates an IPython InteractiveShell, then runs import fastai.callbacks.progress which adds ProgressCallback to the the variable fastcore.basics.defaults.\nWorker 1 processes another task, say task 3, which creates a fresh InteractiveShell, calls learner.fit, and tests stdout. Since ProgressCallback has been registered in this process by task 1, a progress bar is also printed to stdout, breaking the test.\n\nLet’s break down the underlying mechanics. There are three behaviours that come together to cause this sequence of events:\n\nProcessPoolExecutors reuse processes. It seems obvious in hindsight since that’s how pools usually work, but I had never realised it until now. In the example above, worker 1 executes task 1 and task 3 in the same process.\nfastai callbacks register themselves on import. In this case, fastai.callbacks.progress adds ProgressCallback to defaults.callbacks.\nChanges to imported modules persist across IPython InteractiveShells. nbprocess_test runs each test in parallel using execnb, which implements a sub-class of InteractiveShell.\n\nNext, we’ll verify these behaviours with tiny experiments. I highly recommend using tiny experiments to understand complex systems."

Since there are no processes in the pool, submit will start a new worker process, and have it execute the task. ProcessPoolExecutor.submit returns a Future object, and Future.result returns the task’s return value:\n\nimport os\n\nfuture = pool.submit(os.getpid)\nfuture.result()\n\n45907\n\n\nNo matter how many times you manually rerun the above cell, it will aways be executed on the same process.

I haven’t confirmed this, but I suspect that when we submitted two futures, the pool determined that it needed more workers, so it started another. However, the first worker’s task ended before the second worker started up, so the first worker processed both.\nSince we instantiated the pool with 2 max_workers, these two processes will execute all tasks, no matter how many we submit:\n\nfutures = [pool.submit(os.getpid) for _ in range(10)]\n[o.result() for o in futures]\n\n[45907, 45907, 45907, 45907, 45907, 45907, 45907, 45907, 45907, 45907]\n\n\nShutdown the pool to free up any resources:\n\npool.shutdown()"

Yes it does, but it turns out that changes to imported modules persist across shells.\n\nfrom execnb.shell import CaptureShell\n\nFirst make sure that CaptureShell doesn’t have a foo attribute - this will make sense in a second:\n\nassert not hasattr(CaptureShell, 'foo')\n\nNow add the foo attribute:\n\nCaptureShell.foo = 'bar'\n\nWe can see foo inside a CaptureShell:\n\nshell = CaptureShell()\nshell.run('from execnb.shell import CaptureShell; CaptureShell.foo')\nshell.result\n\n'bar'\n\n\nThis happens because when we first imported from the execnb.shell module it was cached in sys.modules:\n\nimport sys\n\nsys.modules['execnb.shell']\n\n&lt;module 'execnb.shell' from '/Users/seem/code/execnb/execnb/shell.py'&gt;\n\n\nIn fact, sys.modules['execnb.shell'].CaptureShell is another name for CaptureShell:\n\nsys.modules['execnb.shell'].CaptureShell is CaptureShell\n\nTrue\n\n\nPython caches imports to speed up consecutive imports from the same modules. InteractiveShell (and its sub-classes) have the same sys.modules which causes this behaviour:\n\nshell = CaptureShell()\nshell.run(\"import sys; sys.modules['execnb.shell'].CaptureShell.foo\")\nshell.result\n\n'bar'\n\n\nexec with empty globals and locals uses the same sys.modules too so it doesn’t avoid the issue:\n\nexec(\"import sys; print('execnb.shell' in sys.modules)\", {}, {})\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nexec(\"from execnb.shell import CaptureShell; print(CaptureShell.foo)\", {}, {})\n\nbar\n\n\n\nIn the end, we agreed that the test itself was broken, because it made assumptions about its environment without ensuring that they were true. Tests like this may fail - regardless of the above behaviour - if we import any module that registers a callback. For example, this fails too:\nfrom fastai.callback.progress import *\nfrom nbprocess.test import test_nb\n\ntest_nb('nbs/nb_with_failing_test.ipynb')\nThe fix is to explicitly run learner.fit with the precise list of callbacks required."

I wrote a corresponding step-by-step tutorial as well.\n\n\nAdvent of Code\nI enjoyed taking part in AoC for years 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020.\n\n\nAlfred Github local\nAn Alfred workflow to open GitHub repo URLs via a local workspace directory. No GitHub API access needed!\n\n\npdlog\nSeamless logging for pandas dataframe operations, inspired by tidylog. We used pandas in production extensively at a former workplace, and our code often ended up overwhelmed with logging logic. With pdlog it’s simple: instead of calling, say, df.dropna(), call df.log.dropna() and it’ll log &lt;pdlog&gt; dropna: dropped 1 row (17%), 5 rows remaining."

Shortly after my encounter with reinforcement learning (see below), I realised that deep learning was an important precursor and shifted my studies there.\n\n\nReinforcement learning from scratch\nRe-implementing sections of Sutton and Barto’s Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. My first inspiration in AI was the possibility that a computer could play games better than the best humans! I was determined to build one of these AIs myself."
